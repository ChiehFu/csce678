Check out this great repost from them and visit the #linkinbio to access the mutual aid doc.⁣ ⁣ “For now here's a repost of screen shot from a DIY Mask Manual coming from Harvard Med Students. Great link that has other helpful guides and resources on how to properly create and distribute masks. Link: bit.ly/COV19info doc under Mutual Aid & Resources. [please read entire guide OR AT LEAST THE CONTROVERSY AROUND HEPA FILTERS SECTION] ⁣ ⁣ Reposted from @aroseco__ ⁣ ⁣ PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS⁣ 🌿✊🏽👩🏽‍⚕️✊🏽🌿⁣ ⁣ See link in bio for updated science on HEPA filters. 😷⁣ ⁣ THE SCIENCE OF TRANSMISSION⁣ 🧬 ⁣ ⁣ Different size droplets travel different distances. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 mostly spreads via larger droplets (>60 microns in size) which spread 3 feet (1 meter). These droplets require “droplet precautions” which include wearing a surgical mask so these large molecules do not enter the wearer’s mouth. This mode of transmission and protection is similar to the annual flu / influenza. However, unlike the flu, SARS-CoV-2 can also travel via smaller droplets and aerosols which travel as a cloud through the air. N95 masks can help to prevent these smaller cloud particles from infecting the wearer when worn appropriately. The risk of creating SARS-CoV-2 clouds increases with certain medical procedures such as ventilation, which is why doctors and nurses are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. ⁣ ⁣ Healthcare workers experience severe disease and increased transmission risk due to a massive viral load from aerosol exposure and repeated contact with sick patients. The study “Viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19” showed that patients with severe COVID-19 tended to have a high viral load and long virus-shedding period. According to these scientists, viral load of SARS-CoV-2 represents a “useful marker in assessing disease severity and prognosis.”⁣ ⁣ Please donate PPE to your local medical community.⁣ ⁣ ⁣ #coronavirus #corona #covid #maskshortage #PPEshortage #ppe #thepeoplesavethepeople #weareinthistogether #doctor #physiciansofcolor #nurse #sewing #DIY #brighamandwomenshospi","[0.9997582073992547,0.00011929309589576527,0.00012249950484953854]"

The bizarre advice, posted on the Facebook and Twitter pages of Malaysia’s Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development (KPWKM) also said women should wear makeup at home, and avoid loose and casual clothes. Just a week ago, the KPWKM suggested closing down Malaysia’s crisis hotline for women and children as the country went into lockdown over the spread of COVID-19, an idea that was scrapped after widespread outrage. The ministry has since taken down the posters and apologized – saying it was sorry ""if several tips were inappropriate or if they touched on the sensitivities of certain groups"" – language some Malaysians online called ""gaslighting.""

77,853,B-R0BCLDxvo,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-R0BCLDxvo/,"Hundreds of thousands of women known as ASHAs — an acronym for Accredited Social Health Activists, which also spells the Hindi word for “hope” — have been deployed as India’s first line of defense to track down “imported cases” of the coronavirus. These are Indian travelers who might be bringing the virus home from China, Europe or the Gulf countries, where a large section of Indians work as migrant labour. BuzzFeed News spoke to ASHAs in four different states — Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh — who said they had not even been given masks or hand sanitizer while conducting house calls to potential coronavirus carriers. Several spent their own money to buy masks and sanitizers, others were making them at home. Even before the pandemic, ASHAs across the country have gone on strike for being severely underpaid (approximately $80 per month), having no worker rights (they are considered “honorary volunteers” instead of government employees), and frequently finding themselves on the frontlines of both disease and violence.

The change doesn’t stop people from forwarding a message to multiple users individually, but Facebook-owned WhatsApp is hoping to slow down the spread of hoaxes and misinformation. Misinformation, hoaxes, and rumors about the coronavirus outbreak have been rampant online and on messaging apps like WhatsApp, which is used by more than 2 billion users around the world. In India, WhatsApp’s largest market with more than 200 million users, government agencies have been busting WhatsApp misinformation related to the coronavirus.  WhatsApp said imposing these limits led to a 25% decrease in forwarded messages globally at the time. Click our link in bio for more (📸: Dado Ruvic / Reuters)

So said revered investor Warren Buffet, on how economic downturns expose corporate fraud. Thanks to a pandemic, the water has whooshed away at record speed. ⁠
⁠
Booms help fraudsters paper over cracks in their accounts, from fictitious investment returns to exaggerated sales. Slowdowns rip the covering off.⁠
⁠
Many big book-cooking scandals of the past 20 years emerged in downturns. A decade before the crisis of 2007-09 the dotcom crash exposed accounting sins at Enron and WorldCom perpetrated in the go-go late 1990s. Both firms went bust soon after. ⁠
⁠
This economic crisis will expose a decade’s worth of corporate fraud. Who will lose their trunks?⁠

⁠
The microbiologist was once Ethiopia’s health minister. These days he runs the World Health Organisation (WHO), arguably one of the busiest jobs on the planet at the moment. ⁠
⁠
This week it became one of the most thankless ones, too. ⁠
President Donald Trump is accusing the WHO of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic currently sweeping the planet. ⁠
⁠
Certainly, the WHO has its flaws. For example it was criticised last year over its reluctance to declare an international public-health emergency during an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, though it eventually gave way. ⁠
⁠
Dr Tedros has been trying to reform the organisation, but this is hard⁠. And without the clear support of its members, the WHO cannot act⁠. ⁠

According to the poll conducted by research and consulting firm Infotrak, 52 percent of Kenyans think the risk posed by COVID-19 has been overstated, this being blamed on the existing knowledge gaps on the disease. “Knowledge gaps still exist on Covid-19. Majority of Kenyans; 52% still think that the threat of Covid-19 is exaggerated,” states the report. “While Kenyans seem to have high awareness on COVID 19 and how it can be contracted there are several issues that still need education and clarification from government.” Some of the knowledge gaps cited in the report are that 48 percent of Kenyans think Covid-19 is just like a common Flu/cold whereas 35 percent of Kenyans think its better to take the family upcountry to protect them from Covid 19.  The report further shows that 20 percent of Kenyans still believe that black people/Africans can’t contract the coronavirus while 26 percent think young people and children can’t get coronavirus.  In addition, 30 percent of Kenyans believe that everyone who contracts the coronavirus dies while 25 percent think there is a cure for coronavirus.  The poll was conducted between March 30 and April 2, 2020 with a sample of 831 respondents from 24 out of the 47 counties being interviewed.  It further shows that majority of Kenyans; 68%, want the government to declare a complete lockdown of the country to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) while 32% are opposed to the shutdown.  According to the report, whereas a majority of Kenyans support a lockdown, most of them are not at all prepared for such an eventuality.  The survey indicates: 19 percent of Kenyans are ‘very well prepared’ 28 percent ‘prepared’, 17 percent ‘a little prepared’ and 35 percent ‘not at all prepared” for a lockdown.  It further points out that most Kenyans are also not well informed about the coronavirus with 52 percent of those interviewed thinking that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated. #Covid-19","[0.000451687158616458,0.9993965045063058,0.00015180833507778748]"

""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.

168,402,B-oEUauqmyF,http://instagram.com/p/B-oEUauqmyF,"Deepak Natarajan writes.  Researchers in China, South Korea and Singapore have put together a significant amount of information about antibodies that human bodies release in their bloodstreams against the new coronavirus. The presence of these antibodies in the bloodstream could indicate that the person is infected with the virus, and researchers have used this immune response to develop new tests to detect COVID-19 infections faster than the genetic tests currently in prevalent use.  On April 4, the Indian Council of Medical Research issued an advisory “to start rapid antibody-based blood tests for COVID-19 in clusters (with containment zones) and in large [migrants’] gatherings [and at] evacuees’ centres”. The testing protocol is described in a chart in the article.  That is, those who have presented with influenza-like illnesses could, after 14 days of being quarantined, could undergo an antibody-based test. If they test positive, they probably have COVID-19 and may need further hospitalisation. If they test negative, a genetic test (shown as RT-PCR) could be conducted to confirm or reject the result – or they could be quarantined for 14 days more before another antibody-based test.  Testing for antibodies is called serological testing. Such a test can identify who has been infected with the new coronavirus but cannot necessarily identify an active infection. The antibodies can be detected within three to four days after the symptoms develop, and are believed to stay on in the blood for at least a few months. The latter detail is interesting for a second reason.  We know that antibodies released to fight the causative agents of measles and mumps last for a long time in the blood, so once we get these diseases, we are unlikely to get them again. The antibodies against tetanus last for about a decade (which is why we repeat a tetanus shot after 10 years) – as do those against the 2002 SARS virus have lasted for a decade (although by some accounts this immunity could last for up to 17 years).

Despite this optimism, new COVID-19 cases in South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore warn that a new wave of infections may be on the rise in the region. The Chinese government issued a statement recommending people maintain social distancing and avoid others, but these pictures show how thousands of Chinese people disregarded the warnings.

There’s no place to frequently wash your hands, and no access to testing or medical facilities short of life-threatening conditions. Aid groups are warning that the coronavirus could pose a catastrophic threat to the tens of thousands of people housed in Greece’s overcrowded camps, and by extension, to everyone who lives in the country. The Greek government has imposed a police-enforced daytime curfew within the camps, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and closed some camps entirely. New arrivals to the camps, who have not been subject to health checks in the past, are also now being tested for fever. However, dozens of aid groups are warning that the coronavirus will be disastrous for refugees and are calling for the most vulnerable in Greece’s camps to be evacuated. The same concerns hold true for camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya and other locations where refugees are being contained in close quarters. Click our link in bio for the full story.

I’ve recently decided to bring my groceries into my garage and disinfectant them before bringing everything in my house. It is said that viruses can stay on cardboard for up to 24 hours and plastic for 72 hours so I’m going a little extra for peace of mind. I first divided my table in half, a clean and contaminated side. I then wipe down all groceries with disinfectant wipes and place on the clean side of the table. With perishables, I bring into my house and wash with soap and water. With canned and dry goods, I leave on the table and use when needed. This is just my precaution and nowhere have I seen that the virus can be transmitted through the handling or consuming of groceries. The best and most effective way to reduce exposure is washing hands and social distancing. This is something I’m “choosing” to do to reduce my exposure and my families.

Skid Row has been home to people on the margins of society for more than a century. It’s a roughly 50-block area east of downtown, mostly warehouses, low-income housing, single-room occupancy hotels—and tents. A recent study estimated that more than 2,500 of L.A.’s homeless population of 60,000 people (roughly 13 percent live on Skid Row) could be infected by the coronavirus. But despite everything seemingly against them, there is a strong sense of community. As I wrote in a recent online article for National Geographic: “I’ve been taking pictures on Skid Row long enough that I see familiar faces every time I return. It’s the first time working in America that I’ve felt such connection to a community—a place where no matter how broken someone may be, people do their best to take care of one another.” For more follow @michaelchristopherbrown.","[0.8887165673585,0.1109962016461884,0.0002872309953116884]"

Other supposed cures include dabbing an ointment called the “Prophet’s perfume” under the nose to ward off the virus. ⁠

The statement underscores how fundamentally the coronavirus has shaken higher education, where schools are facing once unimaginable changes to their ways of life. Harvard’s president said recently the school is considering ""lots of different scenarios"" for the fall semester.

The gesture of support went viral after Annemarie Plas, a yoga teacher from south London, posted a message on Instagram and WhatsApp. The applause rang out — from the south coast to Manchester, Glasgow, London, and basically everywhere in between. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton's children. ""It made me feel really warm inside that I wasn't the only one that felt like that,” Plas told Sky News after her post went viral. ""It's such a simple message and we take so many things for granted, and now all these freedoms and options are taken away from us, we start to realise [what we have].

As my patients know I exercise before clinic everyday at 6am and am fit as a fiddle ( there is no greater biohacker than me!) in fact I haven’t missed a days work for 5 years! As you have seen from my stories I’ve been wearing appropriate PPE helping in A&E. I developed what started out as a terrible headache which progressed to a temperature, sore throat and persistent cough. This unfortunately further progressed to chest tightness and breathlessness. I had no energy to even stand and only after supplemental oxygen I started to feel much much better. Being a father, husband, son and brother this has made this nightmare all the more real. Let’s fight COVID by following government advice and not succumbing to the luxuries we have enjoyed wantonly for years. I’m glad to say I am on that road to improvement but given isolation it’s a lonely road. Being able to hear your children in the next room but not hold them and sleeping in the spare bedroom without having had an argument with the wife is a tad strange!

270,341,B-jf93MK_I1,http://instagram.com/p/B-jf93MK_I1,"Atanu Biswas writes.  What makes the new coronavirus such a problem relative to the epidemics we have witnessed in the last few decades, such as SARS (2002-2003), MERS (2014) and Ebola (2013-2016)? Mathematical models, also known as compartmental models, may help us answer the question as well as help devise proper strategies to tame the virus’s spread.  The simplest of such models is called the SIR model. It assumes that every individual in a population is in one of three states: ‘susceptible’ (at risk of contracting the disease); ‘infected’ or ‘infectious’ (capable of transmitting the disease); or ‘recovered” (recovered or died from the disease). The SIR model assumes that an individual can be easily identified as an ‘infected’ as soon as the person gets the infection. This is not the case for many epidemic, where the virus has a significant incubation period before rendering the person the ‘infected’. For example, the incubation period is 2-7 days for SARS, 2-14 days for MERS, and 2-21 days for Ebola. For the new coronavirus, it is estimated to be 2-14 days (with a median of 5.3 days). For diseases with a higher incubation period, such as COVID-19, susceptible individuals enter a latent stage called ‘exposed’ following the infection, during which they have a low level of infectivity. An exposed person becomes ‘infectious’ after the incubation period. This is accommodated by the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model, which has been used successfully to understand the Ebola and SARS outbreaks, and is suitable for COVID-19 as well. Different group of scientists have considered the number of such ‘exposed’ individuals to be 20-30-times the number at the ‘infectious’ stage at the early phase of the coronavirus outbreak.  In this model, once we know the number of people who are infected, the severity of the epidemic depends on three factors: the rate at which infected people transmit the virus to susceptible people, the rate at which infected people recover, and the rate at which infected people die.

Actually you can progress and will progress if you stick to this simple advices.  1. Two a day work out split, adding an extra round of cardio (anything for 30-40 mins every other day as well as abs training (basic sit ups and leg raises, vacuums). Here is how your split should look like (incorporate whatever equipment you have - I post stories daily) Day 1 am - chest pm back  Day 2 am - quads pm hams  Day 3 am shoulders pm arms  Day 4 Repeat. Take a day break only if you absolutely feel so.  2. Nutrition - I would def go lower on the carbs and minimum sugars, keep your protein moderately high and fats as medium. Carb cycle or keto are great options. You shouldn’t care about bulking at this time unless you have access to heavier, free weights.  3. Explore and educate yourself on stretching, yoga, functional and mobility work. You may dedicate most of your day to staying physically active in your room.

The nightly projections, which tower over the alpine resort of Zermatt on the Italian-Swiss border, are part of a campaign by Swiss light artist Gerry Hofstetter to temporarily transform well-known buildings, monuments and landscapes worldwide into uplifting works of art.

The livestreamed images will run until April 19, when Switzerland is due to ease lockdown restrictions.

By pumping oxygen into the lungs of patients, the machines are critical for those in danger of lung failure, experienced by about a tenth of #Covid-19 patients. “It’s the last resort before a patient dies,” says Dr Ashok Mahashur, consultant chest physician at PD Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. ⁣ ⁣ There’s no official count of how many ventilators hospitals across the country have at present, but one manufacturer estimates there are 40,000. “Of these around 20 to 25 percent would be dysfunctional,” he says. That leaves around 30,000 to 32,000 ventilators. In normal times, hospitals need only a few dozen machines for critical cases. In these unprecedented times, though, demand will outstrip supply. ⁣ ⁣ According to a study by Brookings Institution, a US-based think tank, India will need 1.1 lakh to 2.2 lakh ventilators by mid-May in the worst-case scenario. It estimates India has a maximum of 57,000 ventilators at present. Another study by John Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, and the Washington and New Delhi-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), predicts that ventilator demand will be 10 lakh. The study estimates that the current availability of ventilators in India is between 30,000 and 50,000. To put this into perspective, the US has an estimated 1.6 lakh ventilators and is running short in most places. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has said that the state alone will need 30,000 ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients. ⁣ ⁣ A young patient with a serious infection of coronavirus needs a ventilator for five to seven days, while an older patient might need it for 2 to 3 weeks, says Mahashur, adding that, “sometimes it may be more than three weeks because their lungs are weak.” This makes the ventilator shortage even more serious | By @varshameghani_; 📸: Arun Sankar /AFP via Getty Images #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusUpdates #Coronavirus","[0.00043048153675722024,0.9994248369564985,0.00014468150674421852]"

⁠
The first lesson learnt from the HIV epidemic was to convince politicians to listen to medical experts and act quickly. ⁠
⁠
Cyril Ramaphosa has done just that. South Africa introduced social distancing on March 15th. The country’s covid-19 caseload appeared to be on a Britain-like trajectory, but it now looks to be on a path similar to South Korea. ⁠
⁠
Secondly, social distancing in South Africa's townships is not possible. Instead health workers go from house to house to screen, test and trace infected people—as they did during the HIV crisis. ⁠

⁠
As the pandemic shutters businesses and leaves supermarket shelves bare, some economists fret that inflation will make an unwelcome return. But that seems unlikely—until, perhaps, the world’s struggle with covid-19 nears its end. ⁠
⁠
In some circumstances the drop in demand induced by a supply shock may be larger than the decline in supply—a source of deflationary, rather than inflationary, pressure.⁠
⁠
But in the aftermath of the pandemic, governments could start to prefer high growth and low unemployment to low, stable inflation. More generous post-pandemic safety-nets could create inflationary pressure. ⁠
⁠
Inflation is not certain to return after covid-19. But click on the link in our bio to read why its re-emergence seems less fantastic a possibility. ⁠

On the one hand it’s reaffirming to read someone so clearly state what I’ve only begun to realize. On the other hand it’s making me face the long-lasting harm I’ve argued for just last week when I felt like it was best to grade kids for the work they’re assigned right now (or to assign any required work at all, I’m starting to realize). I’m wondering where that comes from—my gut instinct to assign work & then grade it during a literal pandemic—capitalistic notions of productivity, maybe? Regardless it seems a pretty dehumanizing idea of fairness. And on the other hand (I have three hands now), it makes me wonder how much I can actually do about this. My administration is heavily involved in this entire process, including how much work we assign per day, how we grade it, & the decision that we’re going forward with retention plans. How are others walking this line? Please advise.","[0.9994477616652986,0.00027245755418406256,0.0002797807805174815]"

408,836,B_QvggfoaoJ,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_QvggfoaoJ/,"Health experts say Jair Bolsonaro has set Brazil on a dangerous path. Bolsonaro has not only ignored the advice of experts but encouraged people to go out, putting their lives at risk. He has continued touring markets and accused journalists of stoking fear to undermine his administration. Those most at risk? People who live in favelas. It is the poorest people who must keep leaving their houses to earn a days’ wage. It is they who are the least likely to get proper medical care if complications arise. And Brazil has the highest income inequality gap in Latin America. For these Brazilians, life has been reduced to a Catch-22: Many want to stay home and stop the spread of the coronavirus, but they live cramped together in tiny quarters, where one contagion can quickly multiply. But mostly, they cannot afford not to go out to work. “There’s the doorman, the cleaning lady,” Severino Franco, of the Rocinha Association of Culture, Art, and Sport, told BuzzFeed News. “If that person doesn’t go to work, they lose. This moment shows the social disparity between the hills and the city.” Across the country, 37,437 people have tested positive for COVID-19 and 2,388 have died. Across Rio de Janeiro’s favelas, at least 10 people have died. In Rocinha, Brazil’s biggest favela, there are at least 34 confirmed cases. But the number is probably much higher, according to experts. Read more through the link in our bio 🇧🇷🌍 (📷: Getty Images)

These are facts. When you go to the grocery store that my husband manages, he’s at risk for getting it and bringing it home to us. When he tells me he sees people walking around the grocery store taking their time and just hanging out like it’s another day, I am horrified. I talked about this in stories today and really feel pulled to talk about it here tonight.  Friends. Stay home. This is inconvenient. This is irritating. This is depressing. This is scary. This is sad. This is unknown. This is historic. We have to look out for each other. Every time you sneak out of the house to grab something nonessential you are potentially putting someone’s loved one in harms way. Someone who doesn’t have a CHOICE but to work during this pandemic FOR YOU. To serve YOU. Please, please, please think before you leave. And when you do need to leave for something essential, please take precautions. My husband and most grocery store employees and other essential workers don’t have any sort of masks or gloves to protect them from what you may bring with you. This isn’t a time to browse, or touch lots of things and put them back. Get in there, get what you need, be graceful and polite and go right back home.  It’s hard to find joy in these days sometimes. It’s hard to see a light at the end of a tunnel that seems long and dark. It’s hard to keep the faith and have hope that better days are ahead...but they are!

From Love, the greatest of courage is derived, hence becoming a parent often those who are will tell you, “I never knew a love like this”. This level of spiritual love elevates both courage and selflessness . Passion and romantic love can be so strong it can literally override your natural instincts for better or worse. Pure love can be felt amongst animals and humans as well as intertwined between the two. Love for a cause, passion, or talent can breed uncanny Godly perseverance( often derived from a sense of purpose- your purpose). Spiritually love can even transcend death , hence the iconic eternal scripture of John 3:16 “ For God so *Loved *the world..” - And at its center there is #selflove the root and springboard for loving others and humanity. - Durung this time I implore  you to get acquainted with yourself . To fall (madly) in love, with you. Because only then once we love ourselves (intern birthing our #highestself ) can we truly love others unconditionally. We ALL need each other. This isn’t whimsical talk, it is ***Kinetic Energy. We can emit an actual scientifically proven electrical current (elevated frequency/ raised vibration) from love . Think about your favorite film scene, song, or any iconic speech throughout history that you’ve witnessed that experience prompted a physiological response within you just as powerful and innate as the fight or flight response. Thus we must love ourselves so we may have the loving spiritualritual capacity and energetic ammunitiontion to love and elevate others. - When I look at this photo I see more that meets the eye. I see with spiritual eyes that they are actually making a heart shape refueling each other w/ LOVE, thus breeding hope and endurance. The heart shape is radiant love energy almost like a ring a constant flowing of energy back and forth .God bless these medical professionals whether they know it or not they are  recharging e/o with love energy allowing them to continue to save life through the strengthening power, electrical current,& impenetrable vibration of LOVE♥","[0.999746700778681,0.00012497011159974124,0.00012832910971927682]"

⁠
So what went wrong? ⁠
⁠
One answer is that Britain was slower than European neighbours including France and Italy to introduce restrictions.⁠
⁠
A second is that the government also gave up quickly on the sort of test-and-isolate strategy common in countries that have kept deaths down.⁠

If a quarantined person doesn’t send a selfie, they might be transferred to one of the Indian government’s quarantine centers, which have become notorious for unsanitary conditions. On Twitter, Indians slammed the order, saying it violated their privacy. Earlier this month, the Indian state of Maharashtra started stamping the hands of people flying into the country with invisible ink stating the date until which they must remain in their houses.

In wake of the threat posed by the global coronavirus pandemic, Jacobs ordered a halt to all nonessential movement in the small Caribbean nation of just 41,000 people. Jacobs told residents of the small island, which was devastated by Hurricane Irma in 2017, to treat the pandemic like a natural disaster. In contrast to briefings by US officials and President Donald Trump, which even some people in conservative media have found to be not useful, many people found Jacobs' straightforward tone quite helpful. Others around the world are clamoring for her to-the-point leadership style. Jacobs acknowledged that a lot of people in Sint Maarten are angry about the severity of the lockdown she's ordered, but she isn't backing down 🗣🇸🇽 (🎥: Government of Sint Maarten)

Overwhelmed, the government has been unable to keep up the pace with the dead, and scared of contagion, funeral homes are refusing to handle the bodies. Videos of families dumping bodies on the streets of Guayaquil and of hospital rooms filled with body bags have flooded social media. Though many are difficult to verify, authorities admit that the situation has gotten out of control. In one case, the pregnant niece of a man who died of the coronavirus in their home called 911 countless times to have his body removed. After five days, she finally had to pay several men to carry her uncle's body down to the street, where it was then taken away by a truck. “We demand that the national government come pick up the corpses that are piling up,” Cynthia Viteri, the mayor of Guayaquil said on TV this week. Ecuador currently has 3,163 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 120 deaths, according to the country’s health ministry. Read more at our link in bio. (📸: Getty)

573,863,B99hp6IlOLm,https://www.instagram.com/p/B99hp6IlOLm/,"Kashmir, the disputed region between India and Pakistan, was thrust into a digital black hole in August after India’s Hindu nationalist government revoked an article of the country’s constitution that guaranteed the region a degree of autonomy, and shut down all communication. The government said the move was to prevent militancy and curb the spread of misinformation, but critics said it was to stifle dissent. In March, the government restored the region’s internet, but only at highly restricted speeds that make accessing anything beyond simple text messages over WhatsApp nearly impossible. A new government order, which was released this week, has extended the region’s existing restrictions on internet speed until March 26 to “prevent misuse of social media applications” and following “recent terror activities” in the region. But locals said that the restrictions on internet speed are unacceptable at a time when access to timely and reliable information about the coronavirus is crucial. “Most people in Kashmir don’t really have any information about the coronavirus or what is going on in the world right now. It’s a crisis,” Nayeem Rather, a freelance writer based in Srinagar, told BuzzFeed News. Read more on this story through the link in our bio.

⁠
Antibody-rich “convalescent plasma” (CP) has been used as a treatment for various diseases, including SARS and the pandemic strains of H1N1 and H5N1 influenza. ⁠
⁠
Blood is taken from someone who has recovered from the illness, clotted and then centrifuged, so as to separate out the antibodies it contains, then those antibodies are given to patients in dire need.⁠
⁠
A study in Wuhan found some severely ill covid-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma did significantly better than patients who were not. ⁠A CP research effort in America expects randomised control trials to begin in a few weeks.⁠

I then take those emotions out on loved ones, turn to food, or let them bring me down a dark path mentally. 😔 We have to realize when to let go, no matter how hard or painful, and choose wisely what we give power to in our life. 💯 It doesnt happen overnight. It is small choices of being aware and intune with ourselves mentally and emotionally. Asking ourselves questions to find the root of the issue. Making a plan to work through struggles so that we can come out successfully each time we're faced with them. 👊🏻 I know I may be beating a dead horse to some of yall, but this is why I love @stepbet 👟 These stepbet games have given me the chance for mental clarity.

Solutions on working through current problems. 😁 This alone is the reason I'm thankful I decided to host these games, and the results they have helped me get are the icing on the cake. 🎂 So, if you are looking for some kind of normal... a new routine, a way to safely get some exercise and out the house, I would love to have you along in this new game starting tomorrow.  You have until next Sunday night to sign up before eliminations start for not meeting step goal at the beginning of week 2.  #WithstandTheWeight 🏋🏼‍♀️ ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• *𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝟔 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟔𝐭𝐡! ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ *𝘐𝘧 𝘸𝘦 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝟸𝟶 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳𝘴, 𝘪 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘸𝘢𝘺 𝘢 $𝟻𝟶 𝘷𝘪𝘢 𝘝𝘦𝘯𝘮𝘰, 𝘗𝘢𝘺𝘗𝘢𝘭 𝘰𝘳 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘨𝘪𝘧𝘵𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘥! ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ * 𝘑𝘰𝘪𝘯 𝘣𝘺 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘉𝘦𝘵 𝘢𝘱𝘱 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦.⁣⁣ ⁣ * 𝘚𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 ""𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝"" 𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘱𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘥 ""𝘞𝘢𝘭𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘦𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵""⁣⁣","[0.4912106864024061,0.00015211652431369616,0.5086371970732803]"

✔️ Have the person stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom (if possible).
✔️ Wash hands regularly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
✔️ Give the person who is sick clean, disposable facemasks to wear, if available.
✔️ Check how they are feeling but limit face-to-face contact.
✔️ Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.
✔️ Have their healthcare provider’s contact information on hand and, if they are getting sicker, call their healthcare provider.

614,322,B-jmXJ_gSWy,http://instagram.com/p/B-jmXJ_gSWy,"The hate toward Asians amid the COVID-19 pandemic has not only increased in physical spaces but in the vile corners of the internet too.  On Twitter, hate speech toward China and Chinese people has reportedly surged a whopping 900%, with instigators using the “general feeling of uncertainty and tension to stir up discriminatory behavior.” . The figure comes from a new report from L1ght, an Israeli artificial intelligence startup that analyzed millions of websites, social networks, chat forums and gaming platforms beginning December 2019. . “According to our data, racist abuse is being targeted most explicitly against Asians, including Asian Americans. Toxic tweets are using explicit language to accuse Asians of carrying the coronavirus and blaming people of Asian origin as a collective for spreading the virus,” L1ght noted in its report.  The spike seems to be influenced by quarantine measures enforced to control the outbreak, which consequently forced people to stay at home and spend more time online.  L1ght analyzed text alongside images, videos and voice recordings to identify “increases in hate speech, cyberbullying and general online toxicity.” Researchers witnessed a shift in the use of terminology surrounding the coronavirus.  Original hashtags such as #COVIDー19, #coronavirus, #COVID19 and #StayAtHome were gradually taken over by new hashtags like #chinaliedpeopledied, #KungFlu, #communistvirus, #WuhanVirus and #ChineseVirus.  Aside from a 900% increase in hate posts, L1ght also discovered a 200% growth in traffic to hate sites and “specific posts” against Asians. . “Ch**k, g**k, slant, nip, zipper-head, squint, yellowman, coolie, slope — it’s all sooo confusing! They all look the same. They all eat rice,” one post from a “prominent site” said, according to the report.  Some media outlets have contributed to more hate speech by producing “instigating materials,” L1ght noted. According to the report, one is Sky News Australia, which published a video titled “China ‘willfully inflicted coronavirus upon the world.'” . L1ght also found a 70% uptick in instances of hate speech among youth, as well as a 40% increase in toxicity among gamers.","[0.9997511418517532,0.00012277902157366305,0.00012607912667323478]"

Covid-19 has brought the state back to the heart of British life. Government ministers have taken to appearing at press briefings and the establishment’s many acronym-heavy committees are making regular appearances. ⁠
⁠
But while the establishment has appeared at its polished best, the wild men of Brexit—Jacob Rees-Mogg and Mark Francois—have been consigned to the shadows. Even hard-core Brexiteers have begun to treat Donald Trump as a mad uncle in the attic, says our Bagehot columnist.⁠
⁠
Establishment types maintain that government is a serious business which should be conducted by serious people. And thanks to his personal and professional tussle with the virus, Boris Johnson has rediscovered the essential dignity of statecraft.⁠

⁠
Gradually, cautiously and with only a hazy idea of what works⁠, governments around the world are starting to fumble their way through. ⁠
⁠
South Korea offers some clues about what life might look like post-lockdown: extensive testing, tracing and isolation of infections⁠.⁠
⁠
But even though expanded testing is a priority for countries looking to ease lockdown restrictions, few know how to do this fast⁠.⁠
⁠
And contact-tracing is labour intensive and requires manpower. Apps can help with efficiency, but they cannot replace humans.⁠
⁠
Until a vaccine is available, infected people will need to remain quarantined. Click on the link in our bio to read about the new abnormal awaiting us once lockdowns end. ⁠

636,631,B-ihz1Cg6B_,http://instagram.com/p/B-ihz1Cg6B_,"The hate toward Asians amid the COVID-19 pandemic has not only increased in physical spaces but in the vile corners of the internet too.  On Twitter, hate speech toward China and Chinese people has reportedly surged a whopping 900%, with instigators using the “general feeling of uncertainty and tension to stir up discriminatory behavior.” . The figure comes from a new report from L1ght, an Israeli artificial intelligence startup that analyzed millions of websites, social networks, chat forums and gaming platforms beginning December 2019. . “According to our data, racist abuse is being targeted most explicitly against Asians, including Asian Americans. Toxic tweets are using explicit language to accuse Asians of carrying the coronavirus and blaming people of Asian origin as a collective for spreading the virus,” L1ght noted in its report.  The spike seems to be influenced by quarantine measures enforced to control the outbreak, which consequently forced people to stay at home and spend more time online.  L1ght analyzed text alongside images, videos and voice recordings to identify “increases in hate speech, cyberbullying and general online toxicity.” Researchers witnessed a shift in the use of terminology surrounding the coronavirus.  Original hashtags such as #COVIDー19, #coronavirus, #COVID19 and #StayAtHome were gradually taken over by new hashtags like #chinaliedpeopledied, #KungFlu, #communistvirus, #WuhanVirus and #ChineseVirus.  Aside from a 900% increase in hate posts, L1ght also discovered a 200% growth in traffic to hate sites and “specific posts” against Asians. . “Ch**k, g**k, slant, nip, zipper-head, squint, yellowman, coolie, slope — it’s all sooo confusing! They all look the same. They all eat rice,” one post from a “prominent site” said, according to the report.  Some media outlets have contributed to more hate speech by producing “instigating materials,” L1ght noted. According to the report, one is Sky News Australia, which published a video titled “China ‘willfully inflicted coronavirus upon the world.'” . L1ght also found a 70% uptick in instances of hate speech among youth, as well as a 40% increase in toxicity among gamers.  @nextshark","[0.9997525878038781,0.00012206563288862615,0.0001253465632333636]"

Overall, the last four weeks have marked the largest and most dramatic rise in claims on record since the Labor Department started tracking the data in 1967.

⁠
Britain’s 11,300 care homes look after some of the people who are most vulnerable to the virus. England's chief medical officer says one in seven care homes in the country has already had a confirmed case—and limited testing means the true figure could be even higher. ⁠
⁠
Unlike NHS hospitals, Britain’s care homes are mostly small private businesses and have been left to deal with the crisis themselves. One manager has been told she will have to prepare palliative care, but says she has no medical staff or equipment to provide it. ⁠
⁠
Little has been done to protect residents and staff. Official statistics in Britain remain scant, but in France deaths in care homes make up nearly half of the total. ⁠

We've gone through vacant shelves, panic buying, and nationwide shortages everywhere for basic essentials. . I loved hearing and sharing in some of your experiences from my other post, but the thing that I really loved was reading the stories of people changing to help each other. In just a matter of days after all the panic set in, people started becoming more aware and conscious about what was going on. Stores started getting smarter about how to control things, but most of all I have seen for myself that as a people, we have become more respectful and patient. . While not much has changed outside, we are still in the middle of a pandemic like never before seen, and there are still shortages for some of the essentials. Yet, life has become more manageable. People have begun helping each other more. Separate hours were implemented to help seniors get what they need, and there is more food in the stores now. We don't know for how much longer this will last, but at least it is comforting to see that we can all get through this now with less stress, less fear. .

The evidence suggests that the mammals were somehow involved when SARS-COV-2 crossed the species barrier from animals into humans. ⁠
⁠
That certainly was true of the virus which caused the SARS outbreak of 2002. Bats are also reckoned to be behind the spread of Ebola and Marburg fevers, which are viral infections as well, though not caused by coronaviruses. And vampire bats famously carry another virus, rabies.⁠

But the evidence also suggests that bats are no worse than other animals when it comes to spreading disease. Click on the link in our bio to read the latest research. ⁠

India is restricting the export of most diagnostic testing kits, as coronavirus cases in the South Asian nation topped 3,350 on Sunday despite a three-week nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the respiratory disease.  India, which in recent weeks already banned the export of certain drugs, along with ventilators, masks and other protective gear needed by both patients and medical staff, issued the latest directive on Saturday.  The move comes even as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call on Saturday, to release supplies of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is being tested as a possible treatment for patients with COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus.  The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Asia, home to roughly 1.9 billion people, climbed close to 7,000 on Sunday, even as the death toll from the respiratory disease in the Indian subcontinent rose to 143.  While the figures are relatively low in comparison with the United States, China, Italy and Spain, health experts fear that the spread of the pandemic in South Asia would overwhelm already weak public health systems in the region.

⁠Less than a month later he warned that Hokkaido was “facing a crisis of a second wave”. A state of emergency was reimposed on April 12th.⁠

I have been working with Rebecca for over 3 years now and she’s not just my photographer or friend, she has become like family to me and my Mom.  We work great as a team and she just gets me.  But she also knows how to push me out of my comfort zone and capture moments like these.  It’s tough for artists like Rebecca right now but we’ll get through it together! This dress is a special piece made by my good friend Melina of @generosemx.  I was supposed to wear it to an event that unfortunately got cancelled but I had to share the beauty of it with all of you.  If I can’t find something in my size that I want I can always count on Melina to work her magic for me.  It doesn’t matter what I throw at her, she always embraces it and makes it work.  You can design and create for sizes beyond a 24, you just need to go for it.  I hope and pray that I will be able to make it to Mexico this year, it feeds my heart and soul.

Over 1.3M people have been infected & almost 80K have lost their lives.
This pandemic is much more than a health crisis. It requires a whole-of government & society response. 
WHO's been working day & night to fight COVID- in 5 key areas:
-Supporting countries to prepare & respond
-Providing accurate information & fighting the infodemic
-Ensuring supply of medical equipment for #healthworkers
-Training & mobilizing health workers
-Accelerating R&D

Currently housed at the Neues Museum in Berlin, the bust is believed to have been crafted by the court sculptor, Thutmose, as it was found in the artist's workshop in Amarna, the city built by Nefertiti's husband, Pharaoh Akhenaten. As I was setting up the lights to photograph this glorious artifact, I found myself admiring the details on the Queen's face that made her look more human. It wasn't the symmetry of her face that I found spellbinding. Instead, I was enamored by the subtle wrinkles around her eyes, mouth, between her eyebrows and along her neck, which gave her a look of mature and more refined beauty. At some point, I realized that all the artificial lights I brought along with me on this shoot did not do it justice. For this shot I turned most of them off, relying on the ambient light of the museum, in which Nefertiti's skin tones looked most natural. #treasure #museum #egypt #covid-19 #lockdown","[0.9995111595322472,0.00024117897990933357,0.0002476614878435638]"

As covid-19 keeps workers at home and planes on the ground, demand for oil has fallen faster and further than at any point in its history. Prices are now at a 20-year low.⁠

Last year bankruptcies among American oil producers jumped by 50%. In 2020 that figure will soar.⁠

754,899,B_JmGX3DjFO,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JmGX3DjFO/,"Britain’s government insists it will not ask for a Brexit extension. Why? ⁠
⁠
Opinion polls suggest that a clear majority of voters would accept a longer transition period. But when it comes to Brexit, Boris Johnson’s team are allergic to missed deadlines. ⁠
⁠
An extension would require an entirely new treaty, which might have to be ratified by all of the European Union’s national parliaments—a tortuous process at best. The EU has said it would welcome an extension, but makes clear that it is up to the British government to propose it—and right now that seems unlikely. ⁠
⁠
Both teams agreed to restart online negotiations after two months of little contact because of the covid-19 pandemic. But gaps between the two sides remain.⁠
⁠
Click on the link in our bio to learn more about how the objections to extending the Brexit deadline are purely political.⁠

There have been more than 41,000 confirmed cases in the country, which has been under lockdown since March 10. By comparison, China has a confirmed 3,245 fatalities and 81,155 cases of COVID-19, making its death toll the second-highest in the world. One in twelve people infected by the coronavirus in Italy so far have been health workers, according to an analysis from the National Institute of Health, raising an alarm about the shortage of protective gear they need to treat patients. The city of Bergamo is currently at the center of Italy's coronavirus outbreak, prompting the Italian military to step in after the city's cemetary and crematory were overwhelmed with patients. The head of Bergamo's doctors' guild told an Italian newspaper this week that a quarter of its primary care doctors are ill or in quarantine, describing the situation as ""an apocalyptic scenario.""

Makes me think of the Bible verse “The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps” (Prov 16:9). If I start thinking and planning too many days ahead, I only end up anxious and overwhelmed. So I’m taking it one day at a time. I know that God is in control. He has me exactly where he wants me. His grace is new every morning and he won’t give me more than I can handle. Am I scared? Yep. Am I gonna get out of bed and do my job anyways? Yes, for as long as I’m able. Because I know that God numbers the hairs on my head (which is quite a lot) and has saved up all the tears I’ve cried and all the prayers I pray. I am not alone.

The Ketapang Regency, where our office is located, has now issued regulations to limit transportation and large gatherings, close schools and some non-essential business, and to practice social distancing.  On March 20, we chose to temporarily close down our office, and our staff have been working from home since. Over the years, we have been working to build the capacity of our staff, and the communities we work with, to utilize technology. This now allows us to effectively work as a team during these difficult times, through the power of working remotely, and developing some new, creative methods. Our foreign staff have returned to their home countries and will work from home until international travel is safe again.⁣ ⁣ The world is far more interconnected than ever before, even in faraway villages in Borneo.

⁠
But the covid-19 epidemic has seen production of the shows, which in an evening slot can attract a quarter of the population, grind to a halt. ⁠
⁠
That's proving a headache for the shows' makers. But well as being a cherished form of entertainment, the shows are a vehicle for education and a mirror for current affairs. ⁠
⁠
For instance, a corruption scandal in the 1980s inspired “What King Am I?”, an allegory set in a European kingdom that poked fun at politicians.⁠

Madhvi, a physician's assistant for twelve years at Woodhull Medical Center, had spoken of treating infected patients with only a surgical mask. Her daughter began texting her when her mother was too weak to answer the phone. ""She didn't deserve to pass away the way she did. She deserved to live and see me graduate and become a doctor and get married and have kids...,"" says her heartbroken daughter.  An anesthesiologist and internist in India, Madhvi brought great intrinsic caregiving to her patients at Woodhull. Like many other hospitals in the US, the 320 beds in wards were converted into makeshift ICUs one by one to cope with the pandemic.  It is difficult to say when Madhvi got infected, but she passed away without familiar faces of either colleagues or family around her. Minnoli spoke of texting her mother even after her passing, refusing to accept what was true.  Like Madhvi, several other medical workers have died at the frontlines since the onslaught of coronavirus. Some from the lack of adequate PPE, some from no medical attention following infection. For those who worked gruelling shifts trying to keep others safe, this is the cruellest irony of them all. . . . . . . . . #corona #coronavirus #coronavirusupdates #COVID #covid19 #covid_19 #coronaoutbreak #coronaupdates #outbreak #pandemic #WHO #epidemic #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #Hydroxychloroquine","[0.999574641014555,0.00020985915236618516,0.00021549983307889094]"

During a taped message Friday, Andrés Manuel López Obrador asked people to stay home. The following day, Mexico’s deputy health minister echoed the president’s statement. But no formal quarantine has been put in place. Ignoring his own advice, and that of medical experts, López Obrador has continued to crisscross the country. On Saturday, López Obrador traveled to Culiacán, where he said that “coronavirus is not the plague.” One of the first people to get COVID-19 in Mexico had been a guest at that hotel shortly before, and the building had since been cleaned, he added. On Sunday, it was the turn of Badiraguato, the birthplace of El Chapo. López Obrador said he went to the area to supervise the construction of a road, but nonetheless defended his decision to meet the mother of Mexico’s most notorious drug lord. “She deserves all my respect, regardless of who her son is,” he said during his Monday conference. After news of their encounter emerged, #narcopresidente began trending on Twitter. Watch video of their encounter through the link in our bio.

IMPORTANT UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS:

Today I signed the ""New York State on PAUSE"" Executive Order. This order mandates the 100% closure of non-essential businesses statewide effective 8PM on Sunday. 
I have directed a 90-day moratorium on any residential or commercial evictions to help those financially suffering do to this pandemic. 
I am also announcing ""Matilda's Law"" — which will provide new protections for New Yorkers age 70+ as well as those with underlying health conditions and immune compromised people.

Matilda's Law requires this group of New Yorkers to stay home and limit home visitation to immediate family members or close friends in need of emergency assistance. (If it is necessary to visit such individuals, the visitor should get prescreened by taking temperature.) Both individuals should wear a mask for the duration of the visit.

We know the most effective way to reduce the spread of this virus is through social distancing and density reduction measures. This executive order builds on the actions we have taken to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the wellbeing of our friends, colleagues and neighbors. 
Once again, I want to remind New Yorkers that the panic we are seeing is outpacing the reality of the virus — and we will get through this period of time together.

At least two of the men in the line can be seen wearing a uniform typically worn by private residential staff. A Mumbai resident who requested not to be identified shared the video with BuzzFeed News and confirmed that a man carrying a similar container with a hose visited her neighborhood, said she and other residents were asked to lock their doors and windows so that the liquid would not enter. It's unclear whether the liquid used to disinfect common surfaces like railings and elevator buttons is the same as the one being sprayed on workers in the videos. A similar video of workers being sprayed in northern India caused outrage online just days ago. Click our link in bio for the full story. (🎥: @BuzzFeedNews)

None more so than the brave and dedicated #healthworkers on the frontline, risking their own well-being to care for the sick and fight #COVID19. Wherever you are in the world, we are all incredibly grateful.

For all of us, the best way we can support health workers is to make sure we do not make their job any harder by spreading this disease further.

Liberal ideas are best placed to provide many of the things that Latin Americans want, from justice systems that check the powerful to equality of opportunity.⁠
⁠
And Liberalism has a long history in the region. From the mid-19th century until the 1930s, elected civilian governments opened economies and suppressed church privileges. ⁠

The sky is filled with swooping bats, which indicate good fortune. The leopard symbolizes power, important for military officers. Animals featured on rank badges may also serve as zoonotic reservoirs capable of transmitting viral pathogens that can cause respiratory infections in humans. Some of the birds that signify ranks among civic officials can transmit avian influenza viruses. Bats are reservoirs for Hendra and Nipah viruses and for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Many factors affect interactions among humans, animals and the environment, creating greater opportunities for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, to emerge. One’s rank or status offers no protection from human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral respiratory illnesses. Read the full essay in the May issue of #EIDjournal online now.

We are not only incredibly resilient in times of hardship we are also incredibly resourceful. . .  During this isolation period, when you can't go out, go within. The most important journey you can take is the journey within. This is the place, just beyond every day consciousness, where spiritual empowerment begins. Spiritual power gives you the power to choose creative thinking rather than automated thinking, response rather than reaction, peace, love and harmony rather than stress, conflict and chaos. .  Inside us we have limitless amounts of space that we can tap into to free ourselves from any doomsday thoughts and give us a break from the outer world. Within this space is tremendous peace. .  It is more a silent power in which we have a deeper connection to something far greater than ourselves. Some call it their soul or higher self and others call it the Universe or God. Within that space awaits our true inner peace and freedom to be who we are. If you're feeling a bit tired and drained right now and your mind and body is weary, then journey into your inner space. . .  This will open up your heart, mind and body to new levels of inner peace, joy and aliveness. When we journey into our inner world the most extraordinary thing starts to happen - we start to connect with parts of us that we have forgotten. .  The answers we seek won't be found outside us. They will be found in the silence and stillness of the mind as that is when the doorway to a higher state of consciousness opens and you get direct access to your inner wisdom. .  Meditation enables you to embark on this inward journey. Meditation gives you a clear spiritual understanding of yourself, helps you re–discover and use the positive qualities already latent within you, enables you to develop your strengths of character and create new attitudes and responses to life. You begin to remember things about yourself that you once knew, but had long forgotten. You start to enjoy moments of silence and to savour periods of introspection and reflection. 🌀🕉👁🌈🌀🕉","[0.9997124958300285,0.0001418457902066991,0.00014565837976486773]"

While the delay is temporary, the pain of the unknown and additional waiting is real. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When I was preparing for GCS a few years ago, my surgeon injured her back 4 days before my scheduled surgery. I found out the same day I was supposed to fly out to San Francisco, and didn’t know what to expect. That entire day I was in pieces. I didn’t know what the new schedule would be, and I didn’t know if the new date was going to fit into the plans made at work and those made with those watching with the kids. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I was told to catch the flight - and hopefully she would be ready for surgery near the originally planned date. It ended up pushing a single day. The pain I felt with my reschedule was short - the entire saga lasted only a few days - and that felt like enough to break me. I know people who are now looking at months or potentially years of delay, and my heart breaks for them. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If your surgery has been pushed and you need someone to talk to, I’m here, and so are many others. I know what you’re facing is far worse than my own experience, but I understand how important these procedures are, and I know the pain of uncertainty. We endure so much in this process, and this is yet another burden to bear - but you are not alone, and your time will come. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #transgender #trans #community #curlyhair #transvengers #gcs #covid #life3point0","[0.9995659696661846,0.00021413733122484805,0.00021989300259057741]"

He parked outside the infusion wing and pulled out a poster board. On it, he’d written, “I can’t be with you, but I’m here loving (heart) you!” Albert wasn’t sure if his wife would even see the sign. But it was important for him to let Kelly know he was there, even if he couldn’t be by her side. “I’ve been to every treatment but this one,” he says. “And I promised her I’d be there for every step. I didn’t want to break my word.” It just so happened that the second-floor room in which Kelly received her infusion that day had a window — and it looked out directly onto the section of parking lot where Albert was stationed. So, Kelly could see her husband clearly, along with his message of support. “I suspected he was up to something,” admits Kelly. “He’d talked about driving over and just sitting in the car. I told him not to, that I’d be fine. But that didn’t make the gesture any less sweet. I felt so much love for him in that moment.” #breastcancer #pinkribbons #coronavirus #houston #mdanderson #mdandersoncancercenter #cancerfighter #chemo #chemotherapy #hospital #covid19 #love #marriage #family #endcancer","[0.999499671833351,0.0002468466602346151,0.000253481506414455]"

It will be weeks, even months, before the official tabulations on what is happening will arrive. But already the best available evidence shows that the yawning divides in American society are widening.⁠
⁠
Take New York City, where data from the city's health department show that black and Hispanic residents are twice as likely to die of the disease as white city dwellers.⁠
⁠
Its an uncomfortable pattern that emerges from Milwaukee to New Orleans to Chicago, where black residents are five times as likely to die of covid-19 than white ones.⁠
⁠
And while the uneven health effects of the pandemic are still being worked out, there is little doubt about where the economic effects have been most severe⁠

Workers who are younger, poorer or lack a university education have disproportionately lost their source of income.⁠

1015,839,B--KXiDjmvB,https://www.instagram.com/p/B--KXiDjmvB/,"“You have to keep your sense of humor,” said Mario Sepúlveda, a miner who spent 69 days trapped in a collapsed gold and copper mine in northern Chile in 2010. “Laughing is key.” For Roberto Canessa, one of 16 survivors of a plane crash in the Andes mountains in 1972, the most important thing is to be proactive — not to expect someone else to solve your problems. After Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 went down in the Andes, Canessa spent 72 days in the mountains, watching other survivors die, hearing on the radio that the search for survivors was suspended, and climbing up a towering mountain for 10 days to find help. The circumstances Sepúlveda and Canessa endured were more extreme than those most people will find themselves in during the pandemic: They worried about diminishing oxygen, bone-crushing cold, and having virtually no food. They didn’t know if the ceiling above them would come crashing down or if an avalanche would wipe them out in a matter of seconds. Yet their experiences contain lessons that people can apply during the uncomfortable weeks in quarantine, and what life looks like after a life-altering event.

The media has perpetuate bs beauty standards that you’ve been exposed to for years. once it was thigh gaps and now it’s big butts and maybe in 10 years it’ll be flared nostrils we don’t know 🥴lol) ⠀ I know it’s hard for a lot of us who find a sense of therapy in the weight room. But I promise you that who you are as a *person*, the qualities that your best friend remembers you for and that your parents adore, has nothing to do with your weight. It has nothing to do with your physical body. ⠀ Where I think fitness can play as a double-edged sword is when we start to source *all* of our confidence, validation, and power from the weight room. especially when we use exercise to cope with fear - the fear that if I don’t move, then I’ll be unfit, unattractive, without control, etc. this ultimately threatens our sense of belonging. ⠀ And boys and girls - YOU BELONG. Point blank period💜 ⠀ Remember, workout or not, you matter. Your worthiness is not on the line.

(And if you know me you know I am a pudding monster) Only to binge the foods with guilt later in the day. My mind and body does not deserve to be treated that way. It’s okay if I overeat a little, it’s okay if I eat out of boredom. Eating more chocolate than you were “supposed to” is not going to be the end of the world. During this isolation our eating habits may have changed, maybe we’re eating a little more out of stress, maybe we’re eating less. And all I can do to that is, just try your best. Go easy on yourself.  Try eat SOMETHING today and keep your fluids up! And if anything worsens, reach out for professional help- they are essential workers.

I left lights outside their windows, disinfecting them first. The subjects brought them in, and from outside I directed how to position them. To take these photos, we've complied with all the necessary safeguards. 
Simeone Crispino, 58, is an artist, part of the well-known duo VedovaMazzei. He lives alone in a large house, where at the beginning of the quarantine he brought some of the tools he needed for his craft. “For an artist, continuing to work is fundamental: that’s the only way you get ideas. Yet I must admit that most of the work is done now in front of the computer. They ask us to make performances, installations, and more available on the internet. People need to occupy time and occupying it with art is a good idea,"" he explains. The rest of the time Simeone dabbles in the kitchen and plays his three guitars. In quarantine, he explains, he likes one thing above all: discipline. “I have a lot of friends who would like to break the rules and spend time together. The discipline of isolation allows me to tell them no without guilt.” #covid19 #coronavirus #quarantine #milano

Your cloth face covering should:
✔️ Reach above the nose, below the chin, and completely cover the mouth and nostrils
✔️ Fit snugly against the sides of the face
✔️ Be made of multiple layers of fabric that you can still breathe through
✔️ Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damaging the material or shape

Do not buy surgical masks to use as a face covering. Those are intended for healthcare workers and first responders. Many items you may already have in your home can be used to create face coverings. Try creating a cloth face covering using bandanas, ski masks, washable napkins, or dish towels. www.cdc.gov/coronavirus
