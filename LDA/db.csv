By pumping oxygen into the lungs of patients, the machines are critical for those in danger of lung failure, experienced by about a tenth of #Covid-19 patients. “It’s the last resort before a patient dies,” says Dr Ashok Mahashur, consultant chest physician at PD Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. ⁣ ⁣ There’s no official count of how many ventilators hospitals across the country have at present, but one manufacturer estimates there are 40,000. “Of these around 20 to 25 percent would be dysfunctional,” he says. That leaves around 30,000 to 32,000 ventilators. In normal times, hospitals need only a few dozen machines for critical cases. In these unprecedented times, though, demand will outstrip supply. ⁣ ⁣ According to a study by Brookings Institution, a US-based think tank, India will need 1.1 lakh to 2.2 lakh ventilators by mid-May in the worst-case scenario. It estimates India has a maximum of 57,000 ventilators at present. Another study by John Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, and the Washington and New Delhi-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), predicts that ventilator demand will be 10 lakh. The study estimates that the current availability of ventilators in India is between 30,000 and 50,000. To put this into perspective, the US has an estimated 1.6 lakh ventilators and is running short in most places. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has said that the state alone will need 30,000 ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients. ⁣ ⁣ A young patient with a serious infection of coronavirus needs a ventilator for five to seven days, while an older patient might need it for 2 to 3 weeks, says Mahashur, adding that, “sometimes it may be more than three weeks because their lungs are weak.” This makes the ventilator shortage even more serious | By @varshameghani_; 📸: Arun Sankar /AFP via Getty Images #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusUpdates #Coronavirus",2020-04-06 13:02:07,1875.0,"[0.00047911358510666747,0.9994133494854808,0.00010753692941243998]"

⁠
The Economist analysed the data reported by the country's National Health Commission. What did we find? ⁠
⁠
First, the data are volatile. Across the nine Chinese provinces with serious outbreaks, we identified 15 episodes in which new cases of covid-19 jumped by more than 20% in a single day, before quickly returning to earlier levels. ⁠
⁠
When we compared data from countries and regions with covid-19 outbreaks, of a similar size to these provinces, we found they'd experienced fewer spikes. ⁠
⁠
Second, when spikes in the Chinese data occur, they are often accompanied by important decisions by government officials. Of the 15 such episodes observed in the data, two-thirds appeared to occur within a day of the sacking of a provincial official or other significant political event.⁠

Before you think about going out this weekend just because the weather is nice please think again. As my patients know I exercise before clinic everyday at 6am and am fit as a fiddle ( there is no greater biohacker than me!) in fact I haven’t missed a days work for 5 years! As you have seen from my stories I’ve been wearing appropriate PPE helping in A&E. I developed what started out as a terrible headache which progressed to a temperature, sore throat and persistent cough. This unfortunately further progressed to chest tightness and breathlessness. I had no energy to even stand and only after supplemental oxygen I started to feel much much better. Being a father, husband, son and brother this has made this nightmare all the more real. Let’s fight COVID by following government advice and not succumbing to the luxuries we have enjoyed wantonly for years. I’m glad to say I am on that road to improvement but given isolation it’s a lonely road. Being able to hear your children in the next room but not hold them and sleeping in the spare bedroom without having had an argument with the wife is a tad strange!

Today is food shopping day.😍 I don’t think I EVER payed so much attention to buying food. I used to think “ok, if I forget something I’ll just go back and buy it” because I live very close to a Denner. This store is MY Denner. No, it’s not really mine but it’s mine because proximity.😌 Now I plan all the possible combinations in my head before I go and I always go with a list of things to buy (which my husband puts together over the week when I yell from the kitchen: “Please, add onions!😝🙈 ) and I’m fast, even if I stop to say “Hi” and exchange two words with people who work there and who I know and whom I appreciate for their daily work long before this situation. And I even thank and thanked them long before this situation. I always smile and we talk about weather and little things and now this didn’t change. I even offered myself volunteer to help them about 2, 3, 4 weeks ago when they were working so much to fill the empty shelves. They couldn’t accept my help, not that time, not any other time I offered. Anyways, today is food shopping day 😊 I’m gonna put some make up on and go!☺️ See how we go back to appreciating EVERYTHInG? It took a quarantine because pandemic to really really appreciate a walk on the street, along a lake, grocery shopping or sitting on a bench in a park... among other thousands of little things 😊 This is no ad for the store. It doesn’t need it. It’s just me showing appreciation😘  So let me ask again: Who would sit here??? I know I would!😍 Have a great weekend, guys and don’t forget to smile, keep it together, stay busy, #staysafe and #stayhome !! ❤️🕊 🦄",2020-04-04 16:52:02,2175.0,"[0.999406901794201,0.0004360740007976076,0.00015702420500141707]"

Visitors have recently spotted the majestic and rare snow leopards strolling through the icy expanse of Himachal’s Spiti Valley. Sources say that these big cats are shy in nature, thus estimating the exact numbers of them isn’t easy. The wildlife wing of the forest dept. , however, has roughly estimated that the total count now is above 100. The number witnessed a good rise, as compared to 2016 when the estimated count was 67. Recently, the Nature Conservation Foundation of India, Mysore has surveyed seven places, including Chandra, Bagha, Thandi and Miyar in upper Spiti region and spotted exactly 49 snow leopards in total.

⁠
But despite its European inspiration, the Museum was a quintessentially American experiment. Built by philanthropic financiers and industrialists, it was a “palace in a land where there are no palaces,” as one historian put it.⁠
⁠
Yesterday the institution celebrated its 150th birthday. But due to the covid-19 pandemic, its lavish anniversary celebrations are on hold and the sumptuous 2m-square-foot building on Fifth Avenue is shuttered.⁠

⁠
Many of the measures that made that reopening possible were changes to existing protocols; more hygiene measures, more separation between workers, and screening.⁠
⁠
But investment in automation and remote operation has also helped to accelerate improvements not expected for some time to come.⁠
⁠
One example is in new product introduction (NPI).⁠
⁠
During NPI engineers from companies abroad fly in to tweak and tune the development of new products—something which today’s all-but-closed Chinese border makes impossible.⁠
⁠
Now, some companies are using machine learning to examine images of every single item a factory makes at every single stage of its assembly. From the other side of the world. ⁠

By pumping oxygen into the lungs of patients, the machines are critical for those in danger of lung failure, experienced by about a tenth of #Covid-19 patients. “It’s the last resort before a patient dies,” says Dr Ashok Mahashur, consultant chest physician at PD Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. ⁣ ⁣ There’s no official count of how many ventilators hospitals across the country have at present, but one manufacturer estimates there are 40,000. “Of these around 20 to 25 percent would be dysfunctional,” he says. That leaves around 30,000 to 32,000 ventilators. In normal times, hospitals need only a few dozen machines for critical cases. In these unprecedented times, though, demand will outstrip supply. ⁣ ⁣ According to a study by Brookings Institution, a US-based think tank, India will need 1.1 lakh to 2.2 lakh ventilators by mid-May in the worst-case scenario. It estimates India has a maximum of 57,000 ventilators at present. Another study by John Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, and the Washington and New Delhi-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), predicts that ventilator demand will be 10 lakh. The study estimates that the current availability of ventilators in India is between 30,000 and 50,000. To put this into perspective, the US has an estimated 1.6 lakh ventilators and is running short in most places. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has said that the state alone will need 30,000 ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients. ⁣ ⁣ A young patient with a serious infection of coronavirus needs a ventilator for five to seven days, while an older patient might need it for 2 to 3 weeks, says Mahashur, adding that, “sometimes it may be more than three weeks because their lungs are weak.” This makes the ventilator shortage even more serious | By @varshameghani_; 📸: Arun Sankar /AFP via Getty Images #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusUpdates #Coronavirus",2020-04-06 13:02:07,2554.0,"[0.00047911358510666747,0.9994133494854808,0.00010753692941243998]"

The gesture of support went viral after Annemarie Plas, a yoga teacher from south London, posted a message on Instagram and WhatsApp. The applause rang out — from the south coast to Manchester, Glasgow, London, and basically everywhere in between. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton's children. ""It made me feel really warm inside that I wasn't the only one that felt like that,” Plas told Sky News after her post went viral. ""It's such a simple message and we take so many things for granted, and now all these freedoms and options are taken away from us, we start to realise [what we have]. It's a good time to show how thankful we are.” ❤️ (📷: @sianelvin/ Andy Buchanan/ AFP via Getty Images)

From Love, the greatest of courage is derived, hence becoming a parent often those who are will tell you, “I never knew a love like this”. This level of spiritual love elevates both courage and selflessness . Passion and romantic love can be so strong it can literally override your natural instincts for better or worse. Pure love can be felt amongst animals and humans as well as intertwined between the two. Love for a cause, passion, or talent can breed uncanny Godly perseverance( often derived from a sense of purpose- your purpose). Spiritually love can even transcend death , hence the iconic eternal scripture of John 3:16 “ For God so *Loved *the world..” - And at its center there is #selflove the root and springboard for loving others and humanity. - Durung this time I implore  you to get acquainted with yourself . To fall (madly) in love, with you. Because only then once we love ourselves (intern birthing our #highestself ) can we truly love others unconditionally. We ALL need each other. This isn’t whimsical talk, it is ***Kinetic Energy. We can emit an actual scientifically proven electrical current (elevated frequency/ raised vibration) from love . Think about your favorite film scene, song, or any iconic speech throughout history that you’ve witnessed that experience prompted a physiological response within you just as powerful and innate as the fight or flight response. Thus we must love ourselves so we may have the loving spiritualritual capacity and energetic ammunitiontion to love and elevate others. - When I look at this photo I see more that meets the eye. I see with spiritual eyes that they are actually making a heart shape refueling each other w/ LOVE, thus breeding hope and endurance. The heart shape is radiant love energy almost like a ring a constant flowing of energy back and forth .God bless these medical professionals whether they know it or not they are  recharging e/o with love energy allowing them to continue to save life through the strengthening power, electrical current,& impenetrable vibration of LOVE♥",2020-04-06 11:30:05,1541.0,"[0.9652028847865136,0.03470173064859341,9.538456489286422e-05]"

IMPORTANT UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS:

Today I signed the ""New York State on PAUSE"" Executive Order. This order mandates the 100% closure of non-essential businesses statewide effective 8PM on Sunday. 
I have directed a 90-day moratorium on any residential or commercial evictions to help those financially suffering do to this pandemic. 
I am also announcing ""Matilda's Law"" — which will provide new protections for New Yorkers age 70+ as well as those with underlying health conditions and immune compromised people.

Matilda's Law requires this group of New Yorkers to stay home and limit home visitation to immediate family members or close friends in need of emergency assistance. (If it is necessary to visit such individuals, the visitor should get prescreened by taking temperature.) Both individuals should wear a mask for the duration of the visit.

We know the most effective way to reduce the spread of this virus is through social distancing and density reduction measures. This executive order builds on the actions we have taken to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the wellbeing of our friends, colleagues and neighbors. 
Once again, I want to remind New Yorkers that the panic we are seeing is outpacing the reality of the virus — and we will get through this period of time together.

You deserve love, and you deserve to be at peace with yourself🌻 ⠀ Stay strong my friends💜 ⠀ #fightforgrowth #selflove #mentalhealth #feriha #fitness #instagram #explore #gf #love #beautiful #abs #strong #stayhome #aesthetics #curlyhair #black #punjab #qaurintine #world #coronameme #musclegirls #likeforlikes #followme",2020-04-04 19:13:57,4179.0,"[0.9994010372008811,0.00044038592863358887,0.00015857687048535882]"

I left lights outside their windows, disinfecting them first. The subjects brought them in, and from outside I directed how to position them. To take these photos, we've complied with all the necessary safeguards. 
Giulio and Giacomo Marini, 17, are twin brothers who are used to spending most of their time together: it's what they've always done. Quarantine is not as hard on them as it is for most of their friends, they say. At least they still have each other's company, and they enjoy it. Their day is marked by classes during the morning, while the rest of the time is occupied by ""video calls with our friends and long workouts on the exercise bike, which replace training with our football team,"" says Giulio. 
Nonetheless, even if killing time is not a problem ""the situation is starting to worry us. At the beginning maybe we didn't understand the seriousness of it all; now the numbers of those killed by the virus are becoming a nightmare,"" they explain. They both stay updated with the news and their biggest fear is ""not knowing when all this will end. There is a lot of uncertainty. And we miss our friends very much.” #covid19 #coronavirus #quarantine #milano

These are Indian travelers who might be bringing the virus home from China, Europe or the Gulf countries, where a large section of Indians work as migrant labour. BuzzFeed News spoke to ASHAs in four different states — Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh — who said they had not even been given masks or hand sanitizer while conducting house calls to potential coronavirus carriers. Several spent their own money to buy masks and sanitizers, others were making them at home. Even before the pandemic, ASHAs across the country have gone on strike for being severely underpaid (approximately $80 per month), having no worker rights (they are considered “honorary volunteers” instead of government employees), and frequently finding themselves on the frontlines of both disease and violence.

At least two of the men in the line can be seen wearing a uniform typically worn by private residential staff. A Mumbai resident who requested not to be identified shared the video with BuzzFeed News and confirmed that a man carrying a similar container with a hose visited her neighborhood, said she and other residents were asked to lock their doors and windows so that the liquid would not enter. It's unclear whether the liquid used to disinfect common surfaces like railings and elevator buttons is the same as the one being sprayed on workers in the videos. A similar video of workers being sprayed in northern India caused outrage online just days ago. Click our link in bio for the full story. (🎥: @BuzzFeedNews)

Madhvi, a physician's assistant for twelve years at Woodhull Medical Center, had spoken of treating infected patients with only a surgical mask. Her daughter began texting her when her mother was too weak to answer the phone. ""She didn't deserve to pass away the way she did. She deserved to live and see me graduate and become a doctor and get married and have kids...,"" says her heartbroken daughter.  An anesthesiologist and internist in India, Madhvi brought great intrinsic caregiving to her patients at Woodhull. Like many other hospitals in the US, the 320 beds in wards were converted into makeshift ICUs one by one to cope with the pandemic.  It is difficult to say when Madhvi got infected, but she passed away without familiar faces of either colleagues or family around her. Minnoli spoke of texting her mother even after her passing, refusing to accept what was true.  Like Madhvi, several other medical workers have died at the frontlines since the onslaught of coronavirus. Some from the lack of adequate PPE, some from no medical attention following infection. For those who worked gruelling shifts trying to keep others safe, this is the cruellest irony of them all. . . . . . . . . #corona #coronavirus #coronavirusupdates #COVID #covid19 #covid_19 #coronaoutbreak #coronaupdates #outbreak #pandemic #WHO #epidemic #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #Hydroxychloroquine",2020-04-17 14:21:31,1000.0,"[0.0007135714012405747,0.9991262680504247,0.00016016054833481184]"

⁠
It will be weeks, even months, before the official tabulations on what is happening will arrive. But already the best available evidence shows that the yawning divides in American society are widening.⁠
⁠
Take New York City, where data from the city's health department show that black and Hispanic residents are twice as likely to die of the disease as white city dwellers.⁠
⁠
Its an uncomfortable pattern that emerges from Milwaukee to New Orleans to Chicago, where black residents are five times as likely to die of covid-19 than white ones.⁠
⁠
And while the uneven health effects of the pandemic are still being worked out, there is little doubt about where the economic effects have been most severe⁠
⁠
Workers who are younger, poorer or lack a university education have disproportionately lost their source of income.⁠
⁠
Click on the link in our bio to read why in America, some already yawning gaps are being pushed farther apart by the virus.⁠

I’ve recently decided to bring my groceries into my garage and disinfectant them before bringing everything in my house. It is said that viruses can stay on cardboard for up to 24 hours and plastic for 72 hours so I’m going a little extra for peace of mind. I first divided my table in half, a clean and contaminated side. I then wipe down all groceries with disinfectant wipes and place on the clean side of the table. With perishables, I bring into my house and wash with soap and water. With canned and dry goods, I leave on the table and use when needed. This is just my precaution and nowhere have I seen that the virus can be transmitted through the handling or consuming of groceries. The best and most effective way to reduce exposure is washing hands and social distancing. This is something I’m “choosing” to do to reduce my exposure and my families.

There’s no place to frequently wash your hands, and no access to testing or medical facilities short of life-threatening conditions. Aid groups are warning that the coronavirus could pose a catastrophic threat to the tens of thousands of people housed in Greece’s overcrowded camps, and by extension, to everyone who lives in the country. The Greek government has imposed a police-enforced daytime curfew within the camps, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and closed some camps entirely. New arrivals to the camps, who have not been subject to health checks in the past, are also now being tested for fever. However, dozens of aid groups are warning that the coronavirus will be disastrous for refugees and are calling for the most vulnerable in Greece’s camps to be evacuated. The same concerns hold true for camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya and other locations where refugees are being contained in close quarters. Click our link in bio for the full story.

In wake of the threat posed by the global coronavirus pandemic, Jacobs ordered a halt to all nonessential movement in the small Caribbean nation of just 41,000 people. Jacobs told residents of the small island, which was devastated by Hurricane Irma in 2017, to treat the pandemic like a natural disaster. In contrast to briefings by US officials and President Donald Trump, which even some people in conservative media have found to be not useful, many people found Jacobs' straightforward tone quite helpful. Others around the world are clamoring for her to-the-point leadership style. Jacobs acknowledged that a lot of people in Sint Maarten are angry about the severity of the lockdown she's ordered, but she isn't backing down 🗣🇸🇽 (🎥: Government of Sint Maarten)

⁠
There are reportedly 86 candidates, and the range of options being studied is remarkable. ⁠
⁠
Billions of dollars will be wasted in developing a vaccine, but compared with trillions of dollars of lost economic output, overspending on vaccines is trivial. ⁠
⁠
Governments, charities and other potential buyers must assure the industry that they will pay for what it produces, and spend billions of dollars building manufacturing plants for leading candidates.⁠

The World Health Organization clearly states that medical masks should be for healthcare workers, not for the general public.
But some countries don't agree, with several governments telling people they need to wear masks whenever they go out.

According to the poll conducted by research and consulting firm Infotrak, 52 percent of Kenyans think the risk posed by COVID-19 has been overstated, this being blamed on the existing knowledge gaps on the disease. “Knowledge gaps still exist on Covid-19. Majority of Kenyans; 52% still think that the threat of Covid-19 is exaggerated,” states the report. “While Kenyans seem to have high awareness on COVID 19 and how it can be contracted there are several issues that still need education and clarification from government.” Some of the knowledge gaps cited in the report are that 48 percent of Kenyans think Covid-19 is just like a common Flu/cold whereas 35 percent of Kenyans think its better to take the family upcountry to protect them from Covid 19.  The report further shows that 20 percent of Kenyans still believe that black people/Africans can’t contract the coronavirus while 26 percent think young people and children can’t get coronavirus.  In addition, 30 percent of Kenyans believe that everyone who contracts the coronavirus dies while 25 percent think there is a cure for coronavirus.  The poll was conducted between March 30 and April 2, 2020 with a sample of 831 respondents from 24 out of the 47 counties being interviewed.  It further shows that majority of Kenyans; 68%, want the government to declare a complete lockdown of the country to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) while 32% are opposed to the shutdown.  According to the report, whereas a majority of Kenyans support a lockdown, most of them are not at all prepared for such an eventuality.  The survey indicates: 19 percent of Kenyans are ‘very well prepared’ 28 percent ‘prepared’, 17 percent ‘a little prepared’ and 35 percent ‘not at all prepared” for a lockdown.  It further points out that most Kenyans are also not well informed about the coronavirus with 52 percent of those interviewed thinking that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated. #Covid-19",2020-04-06 16:39:06,1203.0,"[0.0005027107683616755,0.9993844561101515,0.00011283312148673543]"

⁠
According to data from New York City's fire department, New Yorkers are making four times as many emergency calls about cardiac arrests as they did last year.⁠
⁠
Recent figures show that about 200 of the heart-attack victims who called the city's fire department are being pronounced dead at the scene each day, up from around 30 this time last year.⁠
⁠
It is plausible that some of these people were not victims of covid-19. But when New York City's final death toll is reported, it may be bigger than current data would suggest.⁠

During a taped message Friday, Andrés Manuel López Obrador asked people to stay home. The following day, Mexico’s deputy health minister echoed the president’s statement. But no formal quarantine has been put in place. Ignoring his own advice, and that of medical experts, López Obrador has continued to crisscross the country. On Saturday, López Obrador traveled to Culiacán, where he said that “coronavirus is not the plague.” One of the first people to get COVID-19 in Mexico had been a guest at that hotel shortly before, and the building had since been cleaned, he added. On Sunday, it was the turn of Badiraguato, the birthplace of El Chapo. López Obrador said he went to the area to supervise the construction of a road, but nonetheless defended his decision to meet the mother of Mexico’s most notorious drug lord. “She deserves all my respect, regardless of who her son is,” he said during his Monday conference. After news of their encounter emerged, #narcopresidente began trending on Twitter. Watch video of their encounter through the link in our bio.

Here is the MANUAL on how to stay in shape during the quarantine. Actually you can progress and will progress if you stick to this simple advices.  1. Two a day work out split, adding an extra round of cardio (anything for 30-40 mins every other day as well as abs training (basic sit ups and leg raises, vacuums). Here is how your split should look like (incorporate whatever equipment you have - I post stories daily) Day 1 am - chest pm back  Day 2 am - quads pm hams  Day 3 am shoulders pm arms  Day 4 Repeat. Take a day break only if you absolutely feel so.  2. Nutrition - I would def go lower on the carbs and minimum sugars, keep your protein moderately high and fats as medium. Carb cycle or keto are great options. You shouldn’t care about bulking at this time unless you have access to heavier, free weights.  3. Explore and educate yourself on stretching, yoga, functional and mobility work. You may dedicate most of your day to staying physically active in your room.

Dozens of world leaders were due to attend the COP26 gathering in Glasgow from November 9 this year. . The COP26 was expected to be a major climate summit, with around 30,000 delegates, journalists and environmental campaigners. . The Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus (SEC) which was due to host the talks has now become a temporary hospital for patients affected by Covid-19. . Why was the COP26 a key summit? . Five years after the landmark Paris agreement, all nations were due to put new improved climate action plans on the table at the Glasgow meeting. . However, the decision to postpone was inevitable, as international cooperation is now needed to solve the current health crisis. . But could this also be an opportunity? . This crisis has shown that international cooperation and solidarity are essential. COP26 could become the next big example of cooperation betweens countries. . Also, as governments are set to spend huge amounts to boost their economies once the pandemic is over, it might be the right time to make sure this money is spent in sustainable and renewable projects. . Let's hope something good comes out of all this, and that this postponement is for the better 😉 .

Before they could vote, people had their temperature taken, and were told to disinfect their hands and put on plastic gloves. President Moon Jae-in’s Democratic Party of Korea is forecast to win a majority of seats in the National Assembly, according to an exit poll from national public broadcaster KBS. Voter turnout was the highest in 28 years. There was also a record early turnout, with 11 million people casting their votes in advance. Special measures were introduced in South Korea to allow coronavirus patients or those under quarantine to vote. People diagnosed with COVID-19 were given the option of mailing in their ballot, while anyone under quarantine was given a strict time frame to vote at designated polling stations, which they either had to walk or drive to. The elections in South Korea are in sharp contrast to the canceled primaries in the US, or the unsettling pictures in Wisconsin where voters waited for hours to cast their ballots 🇰🇷🗳 (📷: Getty Images)

But the current crisis does not permit people to choose the style of their departure. Instead Ms Heath, who died of covid-19, will be cremated as soon as her daughter’s self-isolation is over. The vicar will be the only other person present.⁠
⁠
Covid-19 is changing funerals. Public Health England has ruled that only close family members may attend, anyone with coronavirus symptoms is banned, and social distancing must be enforced. ⁠
⁠
An initial ruling that gave local authorities the power to order compulsory cremations has been amended to take into account people’s religious beliefs (for some Jewish and Muslim groups, a ritualised burial is essential).⁠

If you are caring for someone who is sick:
✔️ Have the person stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom (if possible).
✔️ Wash hands regularly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
✔️ Give the person who is sick clean, disposable facemasks to wear, if available.
✔️ Check how they are feeling but limit face-to-face contact.
✔️ Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.
✔️ Have their healthcare provider’s contact information on hand and, if they are getting sicker, call their healthcare provider.

It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 mostly spreads via larger droplets (>60 microns in size) which spread 3 feet (1 meter). These droplets require “droplet precautions” which include wearing a surgical mask so these large molecules do not enter the wearer’s mouth. This mode of transmission and protection is similar to the annual flu / influenza. However, unlike the flu, SARS-CoV-2 can also travel via smaller droplets and aerosols which travel as a cloud through the air. N95 masks can help to prevent these smaller cloud particles from infecting the wearer when worn appropriately. The risk of creating SARS-CoV-2 clouds increases with certain medical procedures such as ventilation, which is why doctors and nurses are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. ⁣ ⁣ Healthcare workers experience severe disease and increased transmission risk due to a massive viral load from aerosol exposure and repeated contact with sick patients. The study “Viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19” showed that patients with severe COVID-19 tended to have a high viral load and long virus-shedding period. According to these scientists, viral load of SARS-CoV-2 represents a “useful marker in assessing disease severity and prognosis.”⁣ ⁣ Please donate PPE to your local medical community.⁣ ⁣ ⁣ #coronavirus #corona #covid #maskshortage #PPEshortage #ppe #thepeoplesavethepeople #weareinthistogether #doctor #physiciansofcolor #nurse #sewing #DIY #brighamandwomenshospi",2020-04-06 08:47:36,1661.0,"[0.949177578499829,0.05073136934738684,9.105215278409712e-05]"

Today marked 100 days since @who was notified of the first cases of what we now call #COVID19 in 🇨🇳.
Over 1.3M people have been infected & almost 80K have lost their lives.
This pandemic is much more than a health crisis. It requires a whole-of government & society response. 
WHO's been working day & night to fight COVID- in 5 key areas:
-Supporting countries to prepare & respond
-Providing accurate information & fighting the infodemic

I then take those emotions out on loved ones, turn to food, or let them bring me down a dark path mentally. 😔 We have to realize when to let go, no matter how hard or painful, and choose wisely what we give power to in our life. 💯 It doesnt happen overnight. It is small choices of being aware and intune with ourselves mentally and emotionally. Asking ourselves questions to find the root of the issue. Making a plan to work through struggles so that we can come out successfully each time we're faced with them. 👊🏻 I know I may be beating a dead horse to some of yall, but this is why I love @stepbet 👟 These stepbet games have given me the chance for mental clarity. A time reflect while walking. Fresh air. New perspectives. Solutions on working through current problems. 😁 This alone is the reason I'm thankful I decided to host these games, and the results they have helped me get are the icing on the cake. 🎂 So, if you are looking for some kind of normal... a new routine, a way to safely get some exercise and out the house, I would love to have you along in this new game starting tomorrow.  You have until next Sunday night to sign up before eliminations start for not meeting step goal at the beginning of week 2.  #WithstandTheWeight 🏋🏼‍♀️ ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• *𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝟔 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟔𝐭𝐡! ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ *𝘐𝘧 𝘸𝘦 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝟸𝟶 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳𝘴, 𝘪 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘸𝘢𝘺 𝘢 $𝟻𝟶 𝘷𝘪𝘢 𝘝𝘦𝘯𝘮𝘰, 𝘗𝘢𝘺𝘗𝘢𝘭 𝘰𝘳 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘨𝘪𝘧𝘵𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘥! ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ * 𝘑𝘰𝘪𝘯 𝘣𝘺 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘉𝘦𝘵 𝘢𝘱𝘱 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦.⁣⁣ ⁣ * 𝘚𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 ""𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝"" 𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘱𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘥 ""𝘞𝘢𝘭𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘦𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵""⁣⁣",2020-04-06 07:42:39,1322.0,"[0.999561475184371,0.0003224242948191832,0.0001161005208097609]"

More than 600,000 cases have been recorded in the US alone, while 128,000 people have died globally.
The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, as levels of testing varies by country.

While the delay is temporary, the pain of the unknown and additional waiting is real. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When I was preparing for GCS a few years ago, my surgeon injured her back 4 days before my scheduled surgery. I found out the same day I was supposed to fly out to San Francisco, and didn’t know what to expect. That entire day I was in pieces. I didn’t know what the new schedule would be, and I didn’t know if the new date was going to fit into the plans made at work and those made with those watching with the kids. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I was told to catch the flight - and hopefully she would be ready for surgery near the originally planned date. It ended up pushing a single day. The pain I felt with my reschedule was short - the entire saga lasted only a few days - and that felt like enough to break me. I know people who are now looking at months or potentially years of delay, and my heart breaks for them. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If your surgery has been pushed and you need someone to talk to, I’m here, and so are many others. I know what you’re facing is far worse than my own experience, but I understand how important these procedures are, and I know the pain of uncertainty. We endure so much in this process, and this is yet another burden to bear - but you are not alone, and your time will come. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #transgender #trans #community #curlyhair #transvengers #gcs #covid #life3point0",2020-04-17 15:04:01,1285.0,"[0.9993827262728195,0.000453848993726729,0.0001634247334537549]"

We’ve also added a front shield for easy sanitization and to prevent you from touching the filter from the outside.• • ✨NEW✨ I’ve added a pdf file to the drive with instructions and tips on what we’re using to make our masks. If the mask is too big for you, I’ve left tips on sizing and fitting in there too. If you are printing these, please check that out and share it with any masks you give 😉• • Thank you all for the love and support with this project! We also got some donations yesterday, which we appreciate so much! We’ve already used that money to order more filament, filters, and elastic. 🙏🏼 Mahalo!!!",2020-04-04 08:37:48,1094.0,"[0.9991362815960756,0.0006350468375544776,0.00022867156637008243]"

What makes the new coronavirus such a problem relative to the epidemics we have witnessed in the last few decades, such as SARS (2002-2003), MERS (2014) and Ebola (2013-2016)? Mathematical models, also known as compartmental models, may help us answer the question as well as help devise proper strategies to tame the virus’s spread.  The simplest of such models is called the SIR model. It assumes that every individual in a population is in one of three states: ‘susceptible’ (at risk of contracting the disease); ‘infected’ or ‘infectious’ (capable of transmitting the disease); or ‘recovered” (recovered or died from the disease). The SIR model assumes that an individual can be easily identified as an ‘infected’ as soon as the person gets the infection. This is not the case for many epidemic, where the virus has a significant incubation period before rendering the person the ‘infected’. For example, the incubation period is 2-7 days for SARS, 2-14 days for MERS, and 2-21 days for Ebola. For the new coronavirus, it is estimated to be 2-14 days (with a median of 5.3 days). For diseases with a higher incubation period, such as COVID-19, susceptible individuals enter a latent stage called ‘exposed’ following the infection, during which they have a low level of infectivity. An exposed person becomes ‘infectious’ after the incubation period. This is accommodated by the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model, which has been used successfully to understand the Ebola and SARS outbreaks, and is suitable for COVID-19 as well. Different group of scientists have considered the number of such ‘exposed’ individuals to be 20-30-times the number at the ‘infectious’ stage at the early phase of the coronavirus outbreak.  In this model, once we know the number of people who are infected, the severity of the epidemic depends on three factors: the rate at which infected people transmit the virus to susceptible people, the rate at which infected people recover, and the rate at which infected people die.

We are not only incredibly resilient in times of hardship we are also incredibly resourceful. . .  During this isolation period, when you can't go out, go within. The most important journey you can take is the journey within. This is the place, just beyond every day consciousness, where spiritual empowerment begins. Spiritual power gives you the power to choose creative thinking rather than automated thinking, response rather than reaction, peace, love and harmony rather than stress, conflict and chaos. .  Inside us we have limitless amounts of space that we can tap into to free ourselves from any doomsday thoughts and give us a break from the outer world. Within this space is tremendous peace. .  It is more a silent power in which we have a deeper connection to something far greater than ourselves. Some call it their soul or higher self and others call it the Universe or God. Within that space awaits our true inner peace and freedom to be who we are. If you're feeling a bit tired and drained right now and your mind and body is weary, then journey into your inner space. . .  This will open up your heart, mind and body to new levels of inner peace, joy and aliveness. When we journey into our inner world the most extraordinary thing starts to happen - we start to connect with parts of us that we have forgotten. .  The answers we seek won't be found outside us. They will be found in the silence and stillness of the mind as that is when the doorway to a higher state of consciousness opens and you get direct access to your inner wisdom. .  Meditation enables you to embark on this inward journey. Meditation gives you a clear spiritual understanding of yourself, helps you re–discover and use the positive qualities already latent within you, enables you to develop your strengths of character and create new attitudes and responses to life. You begin to remember things about yourself that you once knew, but had long forgotten. You start to enjoy moments of silence and to savour periods of introspection and reflection. 🌀🕉👁🌈🌀🕉",2020-04-06 10:48:58,6059.0,"[0.9995910788311646,0.000300658286144475,0.00010826288269091595]"

Inside us we have limitless amounts of space that we can tap into to free ourselves from any doomsday thoughts and give us a break from the outer world. Within this space is tremendous peace. .  It is more a silent power in which we have a deeper connection to something far greater than ourselves. Some call it their soul or higher self and others call it the Universe or God. Within that space awaits our true inner peace and freedom to be who we are. If you're feeling a bit tired and drained right now and your mind and body is weary, then journey into your inner space. . .  This will open up your heart, mind and body to new levels of inner peace, joy and aliveness. When we journey into our inner world the most extraordinary thing starts to happen - we start to connect with parts of us that we have forgotten. .  The answers we seek won't be found outside us. They will be found in the silence and stillness of the mind as that is when the doorway to a higher state of consciousness opens and you get direct access to your inner wisdom. .  Meditation enables you to embark on this inward journey. Meditation gives you a clear spiritual understanding of yourself, helps you re–discover and use the positive qualities already latent within you, enables you to develop your strengths of character and create new attitudes and responses to life. You begin to remember things about yourself that you once knew, but had long forgotten. You start to enjoy moments of silence and to savour periods of introspection and reflection. 🌀🕉👁🌈🌀🕉",2020-04-06 10:48:58,7535.0,"[0.9995910788311646,0.000300658286144475,0.00010826288269091595]"

India is restricting the export of most diagnostic testing kits, as coronavirus cases in the South Asian nation topped 3,350 on Sunday despite a three-week nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the respiratory disease.  India, which in recent weeks already banned the export of certain drugs, along with ventilators, masks and other protective gear needed by both patients and medical staff, issued the latest directive on Saturday.  The move comes even as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call on Saturday, to release supplies of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is being tested as a possible treatment for patients with COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus.  The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Asia, home to roughly 1.9 billion people, climbed close to 7,000 on Sunday, even as the death toll from the respiratory disease in the Indian subcontinent rose to 143.  While the figures are relatively low in comparison with the United States, China, Italy and Spain, health experts fear that the spread of the pandemic in South Asia would overwhelm already weak public health systems in the region.

Makes me think of the Bible verse “The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps” (Prov 16:9). If I start thinking and planning too many days ahead, I only end up anxious and overwhelmed. So I’m taking it one day at a time. I know that God is in control. He has me exactly where he wants me. His grace is new every morning and he won’t give me more than I can handle. Am I scared? Yep. Am I gonna get out of bed and do my job anyways? Yes, for as long as I’m able. Because I know that God numbers the hairs on my head (which is quite a lot) and has saved up all the tears I’ve cried and all the prayers I pray. I am not alone.

On Twitter, hate speech toward China and Chinese people has reportedly surged a whopping 900%, with instigators using the “general feeling of uncertainty and tension to stir up discriminatory behavior.” . The figure comes from a new report from L1ght, an Israeli artificial intelligence startup that analyzed millions of websites, social networks, chat forums and gaming platforms beginning December 2019. . “According to our data, racist abuse is being targeted most explicitly against Asians, including Asian Americans. Toxic tweets are using explicit language to accuse Asians of carrying the coronavirus and blaming people of Asian origin as a collective for spreading the virus,” L1ght noted in its report.  The spike seems to be influenced by quarantine measures enforced to control the outbreak, which consequently forced people to stay at home and spend more time online.  L1ght analyzed text alongside images, videos and voice recordings to identify “increases in hate speech, cyberbullying and general online toxicity.” Researchers witnessed a shift in the use of terminology surrounding the coronavirus.  Original hashtags such as #COVIDー19, #coronavirus, #COVID19 and #StayAtHome were gradually taken over by new hashtags like #chinaliedpeopledied, #KungFlu, #communistvirus, #WuhanVirus and #ChineseVirus.  Aside from a 900% increase in hate posts, L1ght also discovered a 200% growth in traffic to hate sites and “specific posts” against Asians. . “Ch**k, g**k, slant, nip, zipper-head, squint, yellowman, coolie, slope — it’s all sooo confusing! They all look the same. They all eat rice,” one post from a “prominent site” said, according to the report.  Some media outlets have contributed to more hate speech by producing “instigating materials,” L1ght noted. According to the report, one is Sky News Australia, which published a video titled “China ‘willfully inflicted coronavirus upon the world.'” . L1ght also found a 70% uptick in instances of hate speech among youth, as well as a 40% increase in toxicity among gamers.  @nextshark",2020-04-04 08:52:18,3411.0,"[0.0004150952015528808,0.9994917367778545,9.316802059257594e-05]"

On Twitter, hate speech toward China and Chinese people has reportedly surged a whopping 900%, with instigators using the “general feeling of uncertainty and tension to stir up discriminatory behavior.” . The figure comes from a new report from L1ght, an Israeli artificial intelligence startup that analyzed millions of websites, social networks, chat forums and gaming platforms beginning December 2019. . “According to our data, racist abuse is being targeted most explicitly against Asians, including Asian Americans. Toxic tweets are using explicit language to accuse Asians of carrying the coronavirus and blaming people of Asian origin as a collective for spreading the virus,” L1ght noted in its report.  The spike seems to be influenced by quarantine measures enforced to control the outbreak, which consequently forced people to stay at home and spend more time online.  L1ght analyzed text alongside images, videos and voice recordings to identify “increases in hate speech, cyberbullying and general online toxicity.” Researchers witnessed a shift in the use of terminology surrounding the coronavirus.  Original hashtags such as #COVIDー19, #coronavirus, #COVID19 and #StayAtHome were gradually taken over by new hashtags like #chinaliedpeopledied, #KungFlu, #communistvirus, #WuhanVirus and #ChineseVirus.  Aside from a 900% increase in hate posts, L1ght also discovered a 200% growth in traffic to hate sites and “specific posts” against Asians. . “Ch**k, g**k, slant, nip, zipper-head, squint, yellowman, coolie, slope — it’s all sooo confusing! They all look the same. They all eat rice,” one post from a “prominent site” said, according to the report.  Some media outlets have contributed to more hate speech by producing “instigating materials,” L1ght noted. According to the report, one is Sky News Australia, which published a video titled “China ‘willfully inflicted coronavirus upon the world.'” . L1ght also found a 70% uptick in instances of hate speech among youth, as well as a 40% increase in toxicity among gamers.",2020-04-04 18:51:19,1148.0,"[0.0004175207916666843,0.999488766765851,9.3712442482227e-05]"

She went on to thank the staff of the National Health Service as well as people who have been staying at home to protect the vulnerable. ""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. Those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.” Local authorities hope that the Queen’s royal address will help persuade people to stay at home during the ongoing pandemic.

⁠
They are especially vulnerable to contracting the covid-19 virus, and hence to transmitting it, for two reasons. ⁠
⁠
First, the homeless are more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions. For example, homeless men in England have a life expectancy of 44, half the national average. ⁠
⁠
The second vulnerability stems from the difficulty they face in practising social distancing. In the tent encampments and night shelters where they congregate it can be simply impossible.⁠

He parked outside the infusion wing and pulled out a poster board. On it, he’d written, “I can’t be with you, but I’m here loving (heart) you!” Albert wasn’t sure if his wife would even see the sign. But it was important for him to let Kelly know he was there, even if he couldn’t be by her side. “I’ve been to every treatment but this one,” he says. “And I promised her I’d be there for every step. I didn’t want to break my word.” It just so happened that the second-floor room in which Kelly received her infusion that day had a window — and it looked out directly onto the section of parking lot where Albert was stationed. So, Kelly could see her husband clearly, along with his message of support. “I suspected he was up to something,” admits Kelly. “He’d talked about driving over and just sitting in the car. I told him not to, that I’d be fine. But that didn’t make the gesture any less sweet. I felt so much love for him in that moment.” #breastcancer #pinkribbons #coronavirus #houston #mdanderson #mdandersoncancercenter #cancerfighter #chemo #chemotherapy #hospital #covid19 #love #marriage #family #endcancer",2020-04-04 08:01:47,39834.0,"[0.9992884661108178,0.0005231535467498173,0.00018838034243240823]"

Around the world, the response from people in every walk of life, to protect and look out for their communities has been inspiring. None more so than the brave and dedicated #healthworkers on the frontline, risking their own well-being to care for the sick and fight #COVID19. Wherever you are in the world, we are all incredibly grateful.

For all of us, the best way we can support health workers is to make sure we do not make their job any harder by spreading this disease further. No matter where you are, the @WHO have shared some guidelines that can help. You may have seen or heard these before, but they are as important today as ever.

It is only in our darkest hours that we may discover the true strength of the brilliant light within ourselves that can never, ever, be dimmed.  Life sucks right now - let's be real. But it’s important to remember that setbacks, failures, and tragedies – however vast or painful they may be – are part of the journey.  Whether we manage to find joy and success in the daily struggle of life is largely dependent on our ability to persevere through any and all adversity with the self determination to never give up.  Stay strong. Believe in today. Believe that you are loved. Believe that you make a difference. Believe we can build a better world. Believe when others might not. Believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Believe that you might be that light for someone else. Believe that the best is yet to be. Believe in each other. Believe in yourself. And know that we believe in you. ......... 📍 Aswan, Egypt ......... 🇫🇷Nous devons traverser l'obscurité pour atteindre la lumière. 🕯 .........

Restez fort. Croyez en aujourd'hui. Croyez que vous êtes aimé. Croyez que vous faites une différence. Croyez que nous pouvons construire un monde meilleur. Croyez quand les autres ne croie pas.

Overwhelmed, the government has been unable to keep up the pace with the dead, and scared of contagion, funeral homes are refusing to handle the bodies. Videos of families dumping bodies on the streets of Guayaquil and of hospital rooms filled with body bags have flooded social media. Though many are difficult to verify, authorities admit that the situation has gotten out of control. In one case, the pregnant niece of a man who died of the coronavirus in their home called 911 countless times to have his body removed. After five days, she finally had to pay several men to carry her uncle's body down to the street, where it was then taken away by a truck. “We demand that the national government come pick up the corpses that are piling up,” Cynthia Viteri, the mayor of Guayaquil said on TV this week. Ecuador currently has 3,163 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 120 deaths, according to the country’s health ministry. Read more at our link in bio. (📸: Getty)

These are facts. When you go to the grocery store that my husband manages, he’s at risk for getting it and bringing it home to us. When he tells me he sees people walking around the grocery store taking their time and just hanging out like it’s another day, I am horrified. I talked about this in stories today and really feel pulled to talk about it here tonight.  Friends. Stay home. This is inconvenient. This is irritating. This is depressing. This is scary. This is sad. This is unknown. This is historic. We have to look out for each other. Every time you sneak out of the house to grab something nonessential you are potentially putting someone’s loved one in harms way. Someone who doesn’t have a CHOICE but to work during this pandemic FOR YOU. To serve YOU. Please, please, please think before you leave. And when you do need to leave for something essential, please take precautions. My husband and most grocery store employees and other essential workers don’t have any sort of masks or gloves to protect them from what you may bring with you. This isn’t a time to browse, or touch lots of things and put them back. Get in there, get what you need, be graceful and polite and go right back home.  It’s hard to find joy in these days sometimes. It’s hard to see a light at the end of a tunnel that seems long and dark. It’s hard to keep the faith and have hope that better days are ahead...but they are! We just have to be good to each other along the way. Every person you come across right now is someone’s family. Every persons life has value. Let’s do our best for each other...and for the Love...WASH YOUR HANDS and keep 6 ft away from people ❤️❤️ Are you an “essential worker”? Do you know one?

Times are tough, but we’d like to share an update about our conservation team working hard in Indonesia. ⁣ ⁣ As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe, it has also reached the cities and towns of Indonesia. The Ketapang Regency, where our office is located, has now issued regulations to limit transportation and large gatherings, close schools and some non-essential business, and to practice social distancing.  On March 20, we chose to temporarily close down our office, and our staff have been working from home since. Over the years, we have been working to build the capacity of our staff, and the communities we work with, to utilize technology. This now allows us to effectively work as a team during these difficult times, through the power of working remotely, and developing some new, creative methods. Our foreign staff have returned to their home countries and will work from home until international travel is safe again.⁣ ⁣ The world is far more interconnected than ever before, even in faraway villages in Borneo. Fortunately, our local staff are able to maintain contact with the communities that still vitally need our support. ⁣ ⁣ To read more about our conservation going virtual, check out our latest newsletter and blog post, and remember, #ActLikeAnOrangutan. ⁣ ⁣ Photo by @timlaman⁣ ⁣ @yayasanpalung⁣ #conservation #covid19 #coronavirus #savewildorangutans #babyorangutan #technology #Borneo #Indonesia⁣",2020-04-06 08:58:49,1132.0,"[0.30822931935186165,0.6916166723108214,0.00015400833731706178]"

Lockdown restrictions in the UK will continue for ""at least"" another three weeks, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said.
At the daily No 10 briefing, Mr Raab said a review had concluded relaxing the measures would risk harming public health and the economy.
""We still don't have the infection rate down as far as we need to,"" he added.
It comes as the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729.

I remember I would go cold turkey on all these delicious foods I loved. (And if you know me you know I am a pudding monster) Only to binge the foods with guilt later in the day. My mind and body does not deserve to be treated that way. It’s okay if I overeat a little, it’s okay if I eat out of boredom. Eating more chocolate than you were “supposed to” is not going to be the end of the world. During this isolation our eating habits may have changed, maybe we’re eating a little more out of stress, maybe we’re eating less. And all I can do to that is, just try your best. Go easy on yourself.  Try eat SOMETHING today and keep your fluids up! And if anything worsens, reach out for professional help- they are essential workers.

Angie, from Maine, has lived by herself for four years. Getting her own space became an important part of her growth and healing after a divorce. But as the US was gripped by coronavirus, the downfalls of her living situation became apparent.
For Angie, this has meant reconnecting with her art. She's started posting daily illustrations as a way to share her emotions and perspective on living alone through the pandemic.

As the coronavirus lockdown started to take hold, Fran, like many freelancers, found her paid commissions postponed.
But she really wanted to document this extraordinary time where so many are isolated at home.
""I have to collaborate with people, asking them to position their laptop or tablet on the other side of the room while I direct them from a far,"" she says.
""It is a really fun way to work, although bandwidth, webcams and light all present big challenges.""

But she also knows how to push me out of my comfort zone and capture moments like these.  It’s tough for artists like Rebecca right now but we’ll get through it together!

I was supposed to wear it to an event that unfortunately got cancelled but I had to share the beauty of it with all of you.  If I can’t find something in my size that I want I can always count on Melina to work her magic for me.  It doesn’t matter what I throw at her, she always embraces it and makes it work.

[please read entire guide OR AT LEAST THE CONTROVERSY AROUND HEPA FILTERS SECTION] ⁣ ⁣ Reposted from @aroseco__ ⁣ ⁣ PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS⁣ 🌿✊🏽👩🏽‍⚕️✊🏽🌿⁣ ⁣ See link in bio for updated science on HEPA filters. 😷⁣ ⁣ THE SCIENCE OF TRANSMISSION⁣ 🧬 ⁣ ⁣ Different size droplets travel different distances. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 mostly spreads via larger droplets (>60 microns in size) which spread 3 feet (1 meter). These droplets require “droplet precautions” which include wearing a surgical mask so these large molecules do not enter the wearer’s mouth. This mode of transmission and protection is similar to the annual flu / influenza. However, unlike the flu, SARS-CoV-2 can also travel via smaller droplets and aerosols which travel as a cloud through the air. N95 masks can help to prevent these smaller cloud particles from infecting the wearer when worn appropriately. The risk of creating SARS-CoV-2 clouds increases with certain medical procedures such as ventilation, which is why doctors and nurses are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. ⁣ ⁣ Healthcare workers experience severe disease and increased transmission risk due to a massive viral load from aerosol exposure and repeated contact with sick patients. The study “Viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19” showed that patients with severe COVID-19 tended to have a high viral load and long virus-shedding period. According to these scientists, viral load of SARS-CoV-2 represents a “useful marker in assessing disease severity and prognosis.”⁣ ⁣ Please donate PPE to your local medical community.⁣ ⁣ ⁣ #coronavirus #corona #covid #maskshortage #PPEshortage #ppe #thepeoplesavethepeople #weareinthistogether #doctor #physiciansofcolor #nurse #sewing #DIY #brighamandwomenshospi",2020-04-06 08:47:36,1985.0,"[0.949177578499829,0.05073136934738684,9.105215278409712e-05]"

⁠
The microbiologist was once Ethiopia’s health minister. These days he runs the World Health Organisation (WHO), arguably one of the busiest jobs on the planet at the moment. ⁠
⁠
This week it became one of the most thankless ones, too. ⁠
President Donald Trump is accusing the WHO of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic currently sweeping the planet. ⁠
⁠
Certainly, the WHO has its flaws. For example it was criticised last year over its reluctance to declare an international public-health emergency during an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, though it eventually gave way. ⁠
⁠
Dr Tedros has been trying to reform the organisation, but this is hard⁠. And without the clear support of its members, the WHO cannot act⁠. ⁠

Researchers in China, South Korea and Singapore have put together a significant amount of information about antibodies that human bodies release in their bloodstreams against the new coronavirus. The presence of these antibodies in the bloodstream could indicate that the person is infected with the virus, and researchers have used this immune response to develop new tests to detect COVID-19 infections faster than the genetic tests currently in prevalent use.  On April 4, the Indian Council of Medical Research issued an advisory “to start rapid antibody-based blood tests for COVID-19 in clusters (with containment zones) and in large [migrants’] gatherings [and at] evacuees’ centres”. The testing protocol is described in a chart in the article.  That is, those who have presented with influenza-like illnesses could, after 14 days of being quarantined, could undergo an antibody-based test. If they test positive, they probably have COVID-19 and may need further hospitalisation. If they test negative, a genetic test (shown as RT-PCR) could be conducted to confirm or reject the result – or they could be quarantined for 14 days more before another antibody-based test.  Testing for antibodies is called serological testing. Such a test can identify who has been infected with the new coronavirus but cannot necessarily identify an active infection. The antibodies can be detected within three to four days after the symptoms develop, and are believed to stay on in the blood for at least a few months. The latter detail is interesting for a second reason.  We know that antibodies released to fight the causative agents of measles and mumps last for a long time in the blood, so once we get these diseases, we are unlikely to get them again. The antibodies against tetanus last for about a decade (which is why we repeat a tetanus shot after 10 years) – as do those against the 2002 SARS virus have lasted for a decade (although by some accounts this immunity could last for up to 17 years).
