It is only in our darkest hours that we may discover the true strength of the brilliant light within ourselves that can never, ever, be dimmed. Life sucks right now - let's be real. But it\u2019s important to remember that setbacks, failures, and tragedies \u2013 however vast or painful they may be \u2013 are part of the journey. Whether we manage to find joy and success in the daily struggle of life is largely dependent on our ability to persevere through any and all adversity with the self determination to never give up. Stay strong. Believe in today. Believe that you are loved. Believe that you make a difference. Believe we can build a better world. Believe when others might not. Believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Believe that you might be that light for someone else. Believe that the best is yet to be. Believe in each other. Believe in yourself. And know that we believe in you. ......... \ud83d\udccd Aswan, Egypt ......... \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7Nous devons traverser l'obscurit\u00e9 pour atteindre la lumi\u00e8re. \ud83d\udd6f .........

We are not only incredibly resilient in times of hardship we are also incredibly resourceful. . . During this isolation period, when you can't go out, go within. The most important journey you can take is the journey within. This is the place, just beyond every day consciousness, where spiritual empowerment begins. Spiritual power gives you the power to choose creative thinking rather than automated thinking, response rather than reaction, peace, love and harmony rather than stress, conflict and chaos. . Inside us we have limitless amounts of space that we can tap into to free ourselves from any doomsday thoughts and give us a break from the outer world. Within this space is tremendous peace. . It is more a silent power in which we have a deeper connection to something far greater than ourselves. Some call it their soul or higher self and others call it the Universe or God. Within that space awaits our true inner peace and freedom to be who we are. If you're feeling a bit tired and drained right now and your mind and body is weary, then journey into your inner space. . . This will open up your heart, mind and body to new levels of inner peace, joy and aliveness. When we journey into our inner world the most extraordinary thing starts to happen - we start to connect with parts of us that we have forgotten. . The answers we seek won't be found outside us. They will be found in the silence and stillness of the mind as that is when the doorway to a higher state of consciousness opens and you get direct access to your inner wisdom. . Meditation enables you to embark on this inward journey. Meditation gives you a clear spiritual understanding of yourself, helps you re\u2013discover and use the positive qualities already latent within you, enables you to develop your strengths of character and create new attitudes and responses to life. You begin to remember things about yourself that you once knew, but had long forgotten. You start to enjoy moments of silence and to savour periods of introspection and reflection. \ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udd49\ud83d\udc41\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udd49", "date": "2020-04-06 10:48:58", "like": 6059.0}, {"userID": "B-njbgADwUN", "imgURL": "https://instagram.ftpe8-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/92080395_2554315731341663_5692587635210976944_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe8-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=XoLvbJdqAWkAX9oJ8gi&oh=af4613fb60543581562646aed8ef1642&oe=5EB31D9F", "text": "I know there is a lot of events that are happening right now, and it's really easy to give in and let these circumstances or situations overwhelm and take control of us. \ud83e\udd2f I've always have been a control freak, and when things happen that are out of my hand, I normally let anxiety control my emotions.

It is small choices of being aware and intune with ourselves mentally and emotionally. Asking ourselves questions to find the root of the issue. Making a plan to work through struggles so that we can come out successfully each time we're faced with them. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb I know I may be beating a dead horse to some of yall, but this is why I love @stepbet \ud83d\udc5f These stepbet games have given me the chance for mental clarity.

I talked about this in stories today and really feel pulled to talk about it here tonight. Friends. Stay home. This is inconvenient. This is irritating. This is depressing. This is scary. This is sad. This is unknown. This is historic. We have to look out for each other.

The media has perpetuate bs beauty standards that you\u2019ve been exposed to for years. once it was thigh gaps and now it\u2019s big butts and maybe in 10 years it\u2019ll be flared nostrils we don\u2019t know \ud83e\udd74lol) \u2800 I know it\u2019s hard for a lot of us who find a sense of therapy in the weight room. But I promise you that who you are as a *person*, the qualities that your best friend remembers you for and that your parents adore, has nothing to do with your weight. It has nothing to do with your physical body. \u2800 Where I think fitness can play as a double-edged sword is when we start to source *all* of our confidence, validation, and power from the weight room. especially when we use exercise to cope with fear - the fear that if I don\u2019t move, then I\u2019ll be unfit, unattractive, without control, etc. this ultimately threatens our sense of belonging. \u2800 And boys and girls - YOU BELONG.

While the delay is temporary, the pain of the unknown and additional waiting is real. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 When I was preparing for GCS a few years ago, my surgeon injured her back 4 days before my scheduled surgery. I found out the same day I was supposed to fly out to San Francisco, and didn\u2019t know what to expect. That entire day I was in pieces. I didn\u2019t know what the new schedule would be, and I didn\u2019t know if the new date was going to fit into the plans made at work and those made with those watching with the kids. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 I was told to catch the flight - and hopefully she would be ready for surgery near the originally planned date. It ended up pushing a single day. The pain I felt with my reschedule was short - the entire saga lasted only a few days - and that felt like enough to break me. I know people who are now looking at months or potentially years of delay, and my heart breaks for them. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 If your surgery has been pushed and you need someone to talk to, I\u2019m here, and so are many others. I know what you\u2019re facing is far worse than my own experience, but I understand how important these procedures are, and I know the pain of uncertainty. We endure so much in this process, and this is yet another burden to bear - but you are not alone, and your time will come. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 #transgender #trans #community #curlyhair #transvengers #gcs #covid #life3point0", "date": "2020-04-17 15:04:01", "like": 1285.0}]}
